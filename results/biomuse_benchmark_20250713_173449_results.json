This paper examines the application of AlphaFold2 and related deep learning models for predicting protein tertiary structures from amino acid sequences. We analyze the performance of these models on a diverse dataset of 5,000 proteins and compare results with experimental structures. Our findings indicate that modern deep learning approaches can predict protein structures with remarkable accuracy, achieving RMSD values below 2Å for 85% of test cases. This work contributes to understanding protein folding mechanisms and drug discovery applications.",

Using single-cell RNA sequencing and chromatin accessibility data, we constructed comprehensive regulatory networks for 15 developmental stages. Our analysis reveals novel regulatory modules controlling organogenesis and identifies potential therapeutic targets for developmental disorders.
