          "input_text": "Ensemble of Weak Spectral Total Variation Learners: a PET-CT Case Study Solving computer vision problems through machine learning, one often encounters lack of sufficient training data. To mitigate this we propose the use of ensembles of weak learners based on spectral total-variation (STV) features (Gilboa 2014). The features are related to nonlinear eigenfunctions of the total-variation subgradient and can characterize well textures at various scales. It was shown (Burger et-al 2016) that, in the one-dimensional case, orthogonal features are generated, whereas in two-dimensions the features are empirically lowly correlated. Ensemble learning theory advocates the use of lowly correlated weak learners. We thus propose here to design ensembles using learners based on STV features. To show the effectiveness of this paradigm we examine a hard real-world medical imaging problem: the predictive value of computed tomography (CT) data for high uptake in positron emission tomography (PET) for patients suspected of skeletal metastases. The database consists of 457 scans with 1524 unique pairs of registered CT and PET slices. Our approach is compared to deep-learning methods and to Radiomics features, showing STV learners perform best (AUC=0.87), compared to neural nets (AUC=0.75) and Radiomics (AUC=0.79). We observe that fine STV scales in CT images are especially indicative for the presence of high uptake in PET.",

In 1966, Taylor constructed a free resolution for monomial ideals in polynomial rings, which Gemeda later showed admits a differential graded (DG) algebra structure. In 2002, Avramov proved that the Taylor resolution admits a DG algebra structure with divided powers. In 2007, Herzog introduced the generalized Taylor resolution, which is usually smaller than the original Taylor resolution. Recently, in 2023, VandeBogert showed that the generalized Taylor resolution also admits a DG algebra structure. In this paper, we extend Avramov's result by proving that the generalized Taylor resolution admits a DG algebra structure with divided powers. Along the way, we correct a sign error in VandeBogert's product formula. We provide applications concerning homotopy Lie algebras and resolutions of squarefree monomial ideals.",

Yet office hours, at times, remain an untapped source of academic support. The current study examined whether office hour attendance in combination with a learning reflection would help students learn material in an introductory statistics course. Psychology students were randomly assigned to meet in person with the course instructor and complete a learning reflection form prior to a test. Students who completed these tasks prior to the second test in the course outperformed other students. Office hour attendance combined with reflection may be a useful way to improve students’ understanding of statistics. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)",

          "input_text": "DatasetAgent: A Novel Multi-Agent System for Auto-Constructing Datasets from Real-World Images Common knowledge indicates that the process of constructing image datasets usually depends on the time-intensive and inefficient method of manual collection and annotation. Large models offer a solution via data generation. Nonetheless, real-world data are obviously more valuable comparing to artificially intelligence generated data, particularly in constructing image datasets. For this reason, we propose a novel method for auto-constructing datasets from real-world images by a multiagent collaborative system, named as DatasetAgent. By coordinating four different agents equipped with Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), as well as a tool package for image optimization, DatasetAgent is able to construct high-quality image datasets according to user-specified requirements. In particular, two types of experiments are conducted, including expanding existing datasets and creating new ones from scratch, on a variety of open-source datasets.

Therefore, effectively compressing SAMs has become an increasingly pressing practical need. In this study, we propose Birkhoff, a novel data-free compression algorithm for SAM and its variants. Unlike quantization, pruning, distillation, and other compression methods, Birkhoff embodies versatility across model types, agility in deployment, faithfulness to the original model, and compactness in model size. Specifically, Birkhoff introduces a novel compression algorithm: Hyper-Compression, whose core principle is to find a dense trajectory to turn a high-dimensional parameter vector into a low-dimensional scalar. Furthermore, Birkhoff designs a dedicated linear layer operator, HyperLinear, to fuse decompression and matrix multiplication to significantly accelerate inference of the compressed SAMs. Extensive experiments on 18 SAMs in the COCO, LVIS, and SA-1B datasets show that Birkhoff performs consistently and competitively in compression time, compression ratio, post-compression performance, and inference speed. For example, Birkhoff can achieve a compression ratio of 5.17x on SAM2-B, with less than 1% performance drop without using any fine-tuning data. Moreover, the compression is finished within 60 seconds for all models.",

Recent advancements have primarily focused on refining voxel-level features to construct 3D scenes. However, treating voxels as the basic interaction units inherently limits the utilization of class-level information, which is proven critical for enhancing the granularity of completion results. To address this, we propose \\textbf{D}isentangling Instance and Scene Contexts (DISC), a novel dual-stream paradigm that enhances learning for both instance and scene categories through separated optimization. Specifically, we replace voxel queries with discriminative class queries, which incorporate class-specific geometric and semantic priors. Additionally, we exploit the intrinsic properties of classes to design specialized decoding modules, facilitating targeted interactions and efficient class-level information flow. Experimental results demonstrate that DISC achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on both SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360 benchmarks, with mIoU scores of 17.35 and 20.55, respectively. Remarkably, DISC even outperforms multi-frame SOTA methods using only single-frame input and significantly improves instance category performance, surpassing both single-frame and multi-frame SOTA instance mIoU by 17.9\\% and 11.9\\%, respectively, on the SemanticKITTI hidden test.

However, current publicly available datasets exhibit limitations, such as overly simplistic scenarios, low-resolution footage, and insufficiently diverse conditions, creating a considerable gap between academic research and real-world scenario. To fill this gap, we introduce RoundaboutHD, a comprehensive, high-resolution multi-camera vehicle tracking benchmark dataset specifically designed to represent real-world roundabout scenarios. RoundaboutHD provides a total of 40 minutes of labelled video footage captured by four non-overlapping, high-resolution (4K resolution, 15 fps) cameras. In total, 512 unique vehicle identities are annotated across different camera views, offering rich cross-camera association data. RoundaboutHD offers temporal consistency video footage and enhanced challenges, including increased occlusions and nonlinear movement inside the roundabout. In addition to the full MCVT dataset, several subsets are also available for object detection, single camera tracking, and image-based vehicle re-identification (ReID) tasks. Vehicle model information and camera modelling/ geometry information are also included to support further analysis. We provide baseline results for vehicle detection, single-camera tracking, image-based vehicle re-identification, and multi-camera tracking.

Over-parameterized models such as deep neural networks have an interesting re-descending property in their risk characteristics. This is a recent phenomenon in machine learning and has been the subject of many studies. As the complexity of the model increases, there is a U-shaped region corresponding to the traditional bias-variance trade-off, but then as the number of parameters equals the number of observations and the model becomes one of interpolation, the risk can become infinite and then, in the over-parameterized region, it re-descends -- the double descent effect. We show that this has a natural Bayesian interpretation. Moreover, we show that it is not in conflict with the traditional Occam's razor that Bayesian models possess, in that they tend to prefer simpler models when possible. We illustrate the approach with an example of Bayesian model selection in neural networks. Finally, we conclude with directions for future research.",

However, 7T scanners are costly, scarce, and introduce additional challenges such as susceptibility artifacts. We propose an efficient transformer-based model (7T-Restormer) to synthesize 7T-quality T1-maps from routine 1.5T or 3T T1-weighted (T1W) images. Methods: Our model was validated on 35 1.5T and 108 3T T1w MRI paired with corresponding 7T T1 maps of patients with confirmed MS. A total of 141 patient cases (32,128 slices) were randomly divided into 105 (25; 80) training cases (19,204 slices), 19 (5; 14) validation cases (3,476 slices), and 17 (5; 14) test cases (3,145 slices) where (X; Y) denotes the patients with 1.5T and 3T T1W scans, respectively. The synthetic 7T T1 maps were compared against the ResViT and ResShift models. Results: The 7T-Restormer model achieved a PSNR of 26.0 +/- 4.6 dB, SSIM of 0.861 +/- 0.072, and NMSE of 0.019 +/- 0.011 for 1.5T inputs, and 25.9 +/- 4.9 dB, and 0.866 +/- 0.077 for 3T inputs, respectively. Using 10.5 M parameters, our model reduced NMSE by 64 % relative to 56.7M parameter ResShift (0.019 vs 0.052, p = <.001 and by 41 % relative to 70.4M parameter ResViT (0.019 vs 0.032, p = <.001) at 1.5T, with similar advantages at 3T (0.021 vs 0.060 and 0.033; p < .001). Training with a mixed 1.5 T + 3 T corpus was superior to single-field strategies. Restricting the model to 1.5T increased the 1.5T NMSE from 0.019 to 0.021 (p = 1.1E-3) while training solely on 3T resulted in lower performance on input 1.5T T1W MRI. Conclusion: We propose a novel method for predicting quantitative 7T MP2RAGE maps from 1.5T and 3T T1W scans with higher quality than existing state-of-the-art methods. Our approach makes the benefits of 7T MRI more accessible to standard clinical workflows.",

The current study aimed to examine the temporal relations among expectancies, task values (intrinsic and utility value), and perceived costs (emotional and effort cost) in math to understand the underlying motivational processes for math-related career intention and achievement among middle school girls. To this end, we collected responses from 638 Korean middle school girls three separate times within a year. The autoregressive cross-lagged results revealed that there was no reciprocal relationship between expectancies and task values, but there appeared to be unidirectional positive prediction paths from utility value to self-efficacy. Regarding the costs, there were reciprocal relations between intrinsic value and emotional cost, which negatively affected each other. Consequently, utility value indirectly enhanced girls' math achievement by fostering self-efficacy, whereas emotional cost indirectly hindered their career intentions in math by dampening their intrinsic value. These findings suggest that it is important not only to increase task values, but also to manage costs to help adolescent girls adhere to their math-related career goals.",

However, existing deep learning-based methods face two major challenges: 1) They predominantly adopt a flat classification paradigm, which limits their ability to generate end-to-end multi-granularity hierarchical predictions aligned with tree-structured hierarchies used in practice. 2) Most cross-domain studies focus on performance degradation caused by sensor or scene variations, with limited attention to transferring LCLU models to cross-domain tasks with heterogeneous hierarchies (e.g., LCLU to crop classification). These limitations hinder the flexibility and generalization of LCLU models in practical applications. To address these challenges, we propose HieraRS, a novel hierarchical interpretation paradigm that enables multi-granularity predictions and supports the efficient transfer of LCLU models to cross-domain tasks with heterogeneous tree-structured hierarchies. We introduce the Bidirectional Hierarchical Consistency Constraint Mechanism (BHCCM), which can be seamlessly integrated into mainstream flat classification models to generate hierarchical predictions, while improving both semantic consistency and classification accuracy. Furthermore, we present TransLU, a dual-branch cross-domain transfer framework comprising two key components: Cross-Domain Knowledge Sharing (CDKS) and Cross-Domain Semantic Alignment (CDSA). TransLU supports dynamic category expansion and facilitates the effective adaptation of LCLU models to heterogeneous hierarchies. In addition, we construct MM-5B, a large-scale multi-modal hierarchical land use dataset featuring pixel-wise annotations.

Several studies have shown that the performance of these 3D perception methods can be further enhanced by combining sequential BEV features obtained from multiple camera frames. However, even after compensating for the ego-motion of an autonomous agent, the performance gain from temporal aggregation is limited when combining a large number of image frames. This limitation arises due to dynamic changes in BEV features over time caused by object motion. In this paper, we introduce a novel temporal 3D perception method called OnlineBEV, which combines BEV features over time using a recurrent structure. This structure increases the effective number of combined features with minimal memory usage. However, it is critical to spatially align the features over time to maintain strong performance. OnlineBEV employs the Motion-guided BEV Fusion Network (MBFNet) to achieve temporal feature alignment. MBFNet extracts motion features from consecutive BEV frames and dynamically aligns historical BEV features with current ones using these motion features. To enforce temporal feature alignment explicitly, we use Temporal Consistency Learning Loss, which captures discrepancies between historical and target BEV features. Experiments conducted on the nuScenes benchmark demonstrate that OnlineBEV achieves significant performance gains over the current best method, SOLOFusion. OnlineBEV achieves 63.9% NDS on the nuScenes test set, recording state-of-the-art performance in the camera-only 3D object detection task.",

Little research, however, has investigated how generating analogies can support college students’ self-regulated learning (SRL) of biology. This study therefore evaluated a contextualized cognitive learning strategy intervention designed to teach students to generate analogies as a learning strategy to aid learning within a university biology course. Participants (n = 179) were taught how to generate analogies as a learning strategy to learn about plant and animal physiology. We hypothesized the quality of students’ generated analogies would increase over time, and their analogical reasoning, knowledge of cognition (KOC; a component of metacognitive awareness), and course performance would be higher after intervention, controlling for associated pre-intervention values. Regression analyses and repeated-measures analysis of variance indicated a positive relationship between generated-analogy quality and analogical reasoning, and increased analogy quality after intervention. No change in reported KOC was observed, and analogy quality did not predict course performance. Findings extend understanding of strategies that can support college students’ biology learning. Researchers and practitioners can leverage our approach to teaching analogies in their own research and classrooms to support students’ SRL, analogical reasoning, and learning.",

While ample research has highlighted the positive associations of expectancy beliefs and task values with academic achievement, research on students' perceived costs is in its infancy. We investigated the temporal interrelations among expectancies, task values and different types of perceived cost, the role of these constructs in biology achievement, and the role of perceived costs as a moderator in the relations of expectancy beliefs to biology achievement. A cross-lagged path analysis of semester-long data from 234 undergraduate biology students pointed to variable relations among expectancies, task values, perceived costs, and biology achievement. For example, while early expectancy beliefs related to later attainment and interest value, early task values and perceived costs did not relate to later expectancy beliefs. Furthermore, early attainment value related to later effort and opportunity cost. Expectancy beliefs and effort and opportunity cost in biology were associated with final biology grade. Finally, effort cost moderated the relations between expectancy beliefs and students' final grades. These findings provide evidence for the dynamic relations among perceived costs, task values, and expectancy beliefs over a semester and point to the interplay between expectancies and perceived costs in their relation to academic achievement in science.",

This is of concern because excessive anxiety can decrease student performance. Levels and sources of student anxiety in three introductory biology lecture classes were investigated via an online survey and student interviews. The survey (n = 327) data revealed that 16% of students had moderately high classroom anxiety, which differed among the three classes. All five active learning classroom practices that were investigated caused student anxiety, with students voluntarily answering a question or being called on to answer a question causing higher anxiety than working in groups, completing worksheets, or answering clicker questions. Interviews revealed that student anxiety seemed to align with communication apprehension, social anxiety, and test anxiety. Additionally, students with higher general anxiety were more likely to self-report lower course grade and the intention to leave the major. These data suggest that a subset of students in introductory biology experience anxiety in response to active learning, and its potential impacts should be investigated.",

To mitigate this we propose the use of ensembles of weak learners based on spectral total-variation (STV) features (Gilboa 2014). The features are related to nonlinear eigenfunctions of the total-variation subgradient and can characterize well textures at various scales. It was shown (Burger et-al 2016) that, in the one-dimensional case, orthogonal features are generated, whereas in two-dimensions the features are empirically lowly correlated. Ensemble learning theory advocates the use of lowly correlated weak learners. We thus propose here to design ensembles using learners based on STV features. To show the effectiveness of this paradigm we examine a hard real-world medical imaging problem: the predictive value of computed tomography (CT) data for high uptake in positron emission tomography (PET) for patients suspected of skeletal metastases. The database consists of 457 scans with 1524 unique pairs of registered CT and PET slices. Our approach is compared to deep-learning methods and to Radiomics features, showing STV learners perform best (AUC=0.87), compared to neural nets (AUC=0.75) and Radiomics (AUC=0.79). We observe that fine STV scales in CT images are especially indicative for the presence of high uptake in PET.",

Sample & methods Undergraduate students (N = 152) learned from a video-recorded lecture, and then engaged in follow-up learning activities involving retrieval practice, restudy, elaboration, or a combination of retrieval practice with elaboration. We ensured that initial retrieval success was high and that all groups had the same expectations about the nature of content to be tested. We assessed both factual knowledge and comprehension, as well as the respective indicators of metacognitive-monitoring accuracy (metamemory, metacomprehension). We assessed self-efficacy and situational interest as motivational variables. Results In a one-week-delayed posttest, elaboration improved factual knowledge and comprehension.

Recent advancements have primarily focused on refining voxel-level features to construct 3D scenes. However, treating voxels as the basic interaction units inherently limits the utilization of class-level information, which is proven critical for enhancing the granularity of completion results. To address this, we propose \\textbf{D}isentangling Instance and Scene Contexts (DISC), a novel dual-stream paradigm that enhances learning for both instance and scene categories through separated optimization. Specifically, we replace voxel queries with discriminative class queries, which incorporate class-specific geometric and semantic priors. Additionally, we exploit the intrinsic properties of classes to design specialized decoding modules, facilitating targeted interactions and efficient class-level information flow. Experimental results demonstrate that DISC achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on both SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360 benchmarks, with mIoU scores of 17.35 and 20.55, respectively. Remarkably, DISC even outperforms multi-frame SOTA methods using only single-frame input and significantly improves instance category performance, surpassing both single-frame and multi-frame SOTA instance mIoU by 17.9\\% and 11.9\\%, respectively, on the SemanticKITTI hidden test.

Therefore, effectively compressing SAMs has become an increasingly pressing practical need. In this study, we propose Birkhoff, a novel data-free compression algorithm for SAM and its variants. Unlike quantization, pruning, distillation, and other compression methods, Birkhoff embodies versatility across model types, agility in deployment, faithfulness to the original model, and compactness in model size. Specifically, Birkhoff introduces a novel compression algorithm: Hyper-Compression, whose core principle is to find a dense trajectory to turn a high-dimensional parameter vector into a low-dimensional scalar. Furthermore, Birkhoff designs a dedicated linear layer operator, HyperLinear, to fuse decompression and matrix multiplication to significantly accelerate inference of the compressed SAMs. Extensive experiments on 18 SAMs in the COCO, LVIS, and SA-1B datasets show that Birkhoff performs consistently and competitively in compression time, compression ratio, post-compression performance, and inference speed. For example, Birkhoff can achieve a compression ratio of 5.17x on SAM2-B, with less than 1% performance drop without using any fine-tuning data. Moreover, the compression is finished within 60 seconds for all models.",

A systematic review and meta-analyses The regulation of motivation is considered a key aspect of self-regulated learning (SRL) as it is presumed that maintaining an adequate level of motivation is essential for engagement, effort and persistence in academic tasks. In this review, we aimed to improve our understanding of motivational regulation strategies, their supposed antecedents and the educational implications. A search was conducted in Web of Science, Scopus, PsycInfo, and ERIC databases. Of 4027 records identified, 64 (75 studies) were deemed eligible after inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied and studies with low methodological quality were discarded. Data on 18 different motivational regulation strategies were available. Extrinsic/controlling types of strategies were reported to be used more frequently than intrinsic/autonomous strategies. Motivational regulation strategies were significantly associated with metamotivational beliefs, academic skills and adjustment. Available evidence supports assumptions of theoretical models on antecedents and academic implications of motivational self-regulation. Educational impact and implications statement The present study provides a compendium of the different motivational self-regulation strategies studied to date, describes the nature of these and unifies the different denominations used. The available evidence on the frequency of use of the different strategies that has been collected may be useful for educators, enabling them to anticipate and adapt to the status of the different motivational facets in students. Drawing on theoretical models of motivational self-regulation, the interconnections between the use of the strategies and their supposed antecedents and the expected educational implications were explored. This will provide researchers and educators with an interpretive framework to draw upon when adapting to interindividual diversity in strategy use and when assessing the compatibility between educational practices and the efficient use and training of motivational strategies.",

Large models offer a solution via data generation. Nonetheless, real-world data are obviously more valuable comparing to artificially intelligence generated data, particularly in constructing image datasets. For this reason, we propose a novel method for auto-constructing datasets from real-world images by a multiagent collaborative system, named as DatasetAgent. By coordinating four different agents equipped with Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), as well as a tool package for image optimization, DatasetAgent is able to construct high-quality image datasets according to user-specified requirements. In particular, two types of experiments are conducted, including expanding existing datasets and creating new ones from scratch, on a variety of open-source datasets. In both cases, multiple image datasets constructed by DatasetAgent are used to train various vision models for image classification, object detection, and image segmentation.",

To address computational demands, Sequential Monte Carlo Squared (SMC$^2$) is well-suited for high-performance computing (HPC) environments. The design of the proposal distribution within SMC$^2$ can improve accuracy and exploration of the posterior as poor proposals may lead to high variance in importance weights and particle degeneracy. The Metropolis-Adjusted Langevin Algorithm (MALA) uses gradient information so that particles preferentially explore regions of higher probability. In this paper, we extend this idea by incorporating second-order information, specifically the Hessian of the log-target. While second-order proposals have been explored previously in particle Markov Chain Monte Carlo (p-MCMC) methods, we are the first to introduce them within the SMC$^2$ framework. Second-order proposals not only use the gradient (first-order derivative), but also the curvature (second-order derivative) of the target distribution. Experimental results on synthetic models highlight the benefits of our approach in terms of step-size selection and posterior approximation accuracy when compared to other proposals.",

In 1966, Taylor constructed a free resolution for monomial ideals in polynomial rings, which Gemeda later showed admits a differential graded (DG) algebra structure. In 2002, Avramov proved that the Taylor resolution admits a DG algebra structure with divided powers. In 2007, Herzog introduced the generalized Taylor resolution, which is usually smaller than the original Taylor resolution. Recently, in 2023, VandeBogert showed that the generalized Taylor resolution also admits a DG algebra structure. In this paper, we extend Avramov's result by proving that the generalized Taylor resolution admits a DG algebra structure with divided powers. Along the way, we correct a sign error in VandeBogert's product formula. We provide applications concerning homotopy Lie algebras and resolutions of squarefree monomial ideals.",

Empirical Insights into Undergraduate Life Science Majors' Emotions about Mathematics Undergraduate life science majors are reputed to have negative emotions toward mathematics, yet little empirical evidence supports this. We sought to compare emotions of majors in the life sciences versus other natural sciences and math. We adapted the Attitudes toward the Subject of Chemistry Inventory to create an Attitudes toward the Subject of Mathematics Inventory (ASMI). We collected data from 359 science and math majors at two research universities and conducted a series of statistical tests that indicated that four AMSI items comprised a reasonable measure of students' emotional satisfaction with math. We then compared life science and non-life science majors and found that major had a small to moderate relationship with students' responses. Gender also had a small relationship with students' responses, while students' race, ethnicity, and year in school had no observable relationship. Using latent profile analysis, we identified three groups-students who were emotionally satisfied with math, emotionally dissatisfied with math, and neutral. These results and the emotional satisfaction with math scale should be useful for identifying differences in other undergraduate populations, determining the malleability of undergraduates' emotional satisfaction with math, and testing effects of interventions aimed at improving life science majors' attitudes toward math.",

The sample consisted of 396 participants in their final year of upper secondary education. Self-report measures were completed of expectancy, STV, gender and socio-economic indicators. These were linked to exit examination grades (A Levels). Only parental education was directly related to achievement however gender and SES were indirectly linked to student grades through expectancy, STV, and the expectancy-STV interaction. Males, students with a higher level of parental education, and students from households with a higher number of possessions, all performed better in their examination due to higher expectations; higher STV amplified these relations. Gender and SES differences in achievement can be partly explained by psychological factors, namely students’ expectations of success and STV.",

Its ability to capture intrinsic similarities and differences among data samples has led to state-of-the-art results in computer vision tasks. These strengths make CL particularly well-suited for Earth System Observation (ESO), where diverse satellite modalities such as optical and SAR imagery offer naturally aligned views of the same geospatial regions. However, ESO presents unique challenges, including high inter-class similarity, scene clutter, and ambiguous boundaries, which complicate representation learning -- especially in low-label, multi-label settings. Existing CL frameworks often focus on intra-modality self-supervision or lack mechanisms for multi-label alignment and semantic precision across modalities. In this work, we introduce MoSAiC, a unified framework that jointly optimizes intra- and inter-modality contrastive learning with a multi-label supervised contrastive loss. Designed specifically for multi-modal satellite imagery, MoSAiC enables finer semantic disentanglement and more robust representation learning across spectrally similar and spatially complex classes. Experiments on two benchmark datasets, BigEarthNet V2.0 and Sent12MS, show that MoSAiC consistently outperforms both fully supervised and self-supervised baselines in terms of accuracy, cluster coherence, and generalization in low-label and high-class-overlap scenarios.",

The current study aimed to examine the temporal relations among expectancies, task values (intrinsic and utility value), and perceived costs (emotional and effort cost) in math to understand the underlying motivational processes for math-related career intention and achievement among middle school girls. To this end, we collected responses from 638 Korean middle school girls three separate times within a year. The autoregressive cross-lagged results revealed that there was no reciprocal relationship between expectancies and task values, but there appeared to be unidirectional positive prediction paths from utility value to self-efficacy. Regarding the costs, there were reciprocal relations between intrinsic value and emotional cost, which negatively affected each other. Consequently, utility value indirectly enhanced girls' math achievement by fostering self-efficacy, whereas emotional cost indirectly hindered their career intentions in math by dampening their intrinsic value. These findings suggest that it is important not only to increase task values, but also to manage costs to help adolescent girls adhere to their math-related career goals.",

CLiFT enables compute-efficient rendering by compressed tokens, while being capable of changing the number of tokens to represent a scene or render a novel view with one trained network. Concretely, given a set of images, multi-view encoder tokenizes the images with the camera poses. Latent-space K-means selects a reduced set of rays as cluster centroids using the tokens. The multi-view ``condenser'' compresses the information of all the tokens into the centroid tokens to construct CLiFTs. At test time, given a target view and a compute budget (i.e., the number of CLiFTs), the system collects the specified number of nearby tokens and synthesizes a novel view using a compute-adaptive renderer. Extensive experiments on RealEstate10K and DL3DV datasets quantitatively and qualitatively validate our approach, achieving significant data reduction with comparable rendering quality and the highest overall rendering score, while providing trade-offs of data size, rendering quality, and rendering speed.",

We examined whether two psychological variables, social anxiety (psychological distress relating to the fear of negative evaluation by others) and academic self-efficacy (confidence in one's ability to overcome academic challenges), interact with student perceptions of evidence-based instructional practices (EBIPs) and associate with their final grades in a STEM-related course. Human anatomy and physiology students in community college courses rated various EBIPs for their perceived educational value and their capacity to elicit anxiety (N = 227). In general, practices causing students the most anxiety (e.g., cold calling) were reported by students as having the least educational value. When controlling for students' self-reported grade point averages, socially anxious students rated several EBIPs as more anxiety inducing, whereas high-efficacy students reported less anxiety surrounding other EBIPs. Furthermore, mediation analysis revealed that individual differences in academic self-efficacy at the beginning of the term explained some of the negative association between students' social anxiety levels and final grades in the course. Our results, obtained in a community college context, support a growing body of evidence that social anxiety and academic self-efficacy are linked with how students perceive and perform in an active-learning environment.",

L-CLIPScore is calculated from a lightweight CLIP (L-CLIP), which is a dual-encoder architecture compressed and distilled from CLIP. To compress, we apply two powerful techniques which are weight multiplexing and matrix decomposition for reducing the parameters of encoders and word embedding matrix, respectively. To distill, we design a novel multi-modal Similarity Regulator (SR) loss to transfer more vision-language alignment knowledge. Specifically, SR loss amplifies the multi-modal embedding similarity if the given image-text pair is matched and diminishes the similarity if the pair is non-matched. By compressing and distilling by this novel SR loss, our L-CLIP achieves comparable multi-modal alignment ability to the original CLIP while it requires fewer computation resources and running time. We carry out exhaustive experiments to validate the efficiency and effectiveness of L-CLIPScore when using it as the judge to evaluate caption quality. We also discover that when using L-CLIPScore as the supervisor to train the captioning model, it should be mixed up by an n-gram-based metric and meanwhile analyze why using L-CLIPScore only will cause fail training.",

We conducted semi-structured interviews of 15 faculty teaching in an introductory biology course sequence to determine (1) what participants viewed as QR competencies crucial for student success, and (2) their perceptions of student preparedness for QR in context. Participant responses fell into four categories (Quantitative Reasoning, Process of Science, Modeling, and Affective Factors) which largely align with competencies called for in recent publications. Additionally, participants noted that many students lacked these QR competencies upon matriculation. Characterization of QR skills crucial for success can help guide curricular reform not only in biology, but also in the context of other STEM disciplines.",

The model is trained on a large-scale dataset of Ubuntu XFCE recordings, which include both randomly generated interactions and realistic interactions produced by AI agents. Experiments show that NeuralOS successfully renders realistic GUI sequences, accurately captures mouse interactions, and reliably predicts state transitions like application launches.

Several studies have shown that the performance of these 3D perception methods can be further enhanced by combining sequential BEV features obtained from multiple camera frames. However, even after compensating for the ego-motion of an autonomous agent, the performance gain from temporal aggregation is limited when combining a large number of image frames. This limitation arises due to dynamic changes in BEV features over time caused by object motion. In this paper, we introduce a novel temporal 3D perception method called OnlineBEV, which combines BEV features over time using a recurrent structure. This structure increases the effective number of combined features with minimal memory usage. However, it is critical to spatially align the features over time to maintain strong performance. OnlineBEV employs the Motion-guided BEV Fusion Network (MBFNet) to achieve temporal feature alignment. MBFNet extracts motion features from consecutive BEV frames and dynamically aligns historical BEV features with current ones using these motion features. To enforce temporal feature alignment explicitly, we use Temporal Consistency Learning Loss, which captures discrepancies between historical and target BEV features. Experiments conducted on the nuScenes benchmark demonstrate that OnlineBEV achieves significant performance gains over the current best method, SOLOFusion. OnlineBEV achieves 63.9% NDS on the nuScenes test set, recording state-of-the-art performance in the camera-only 3D object detection task.",

While hurricane preparedness and response strategies vastly rely on the accuracy and timeliness of the predicted households' evacuation decisions, current studies featuring psychological-driven linear models leave some significant limitations in practice. Hence, the present study proposes a new methodology for predicting households' evacuation decisions constructed by easily accessible demographic and resource-related predictors compared to current models with a high reliance on psychological factors. Meanwhile, an enhanced logistic regression (ELR) model that could automatically account for nonlinearities (i.e., univariate and bivariate threshold effects) by an interpretable machine learning approach is developed to secure the accuracy of the results. Specifically, low-depth decision trees are selected for nonlinearity detection to identify the critical thresholds, build a transparent model structure, and solidify the robustness. Then, an empirical dataset collected after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita is hired to examine the practicability of the new methodology. The results indicate that the enhanced logistic regression (ELR) model has the most convincing performance in explaining the variation of the households' evacuation decision in model fit and prediction capability compared to previous linear models. It suggests that the proposed methodology could provide a new tool and framework for the emergency management authorities to improve the estimation of evacuation traffic demands in a timely and accurate manner.",

This is a recent phenomenon in machine learning and has been the subject of many studies. As the complexity of the model increases, there is a U-shaped region corresponding to the traditional bias-variance trade-off, but then as the number of parameters equals the number of observations and the model becomes one of interpolation, the risk can become infinite and then, in the over-parameterized region, it re-descends -- the double descent effect. We show that this has a natural Bayesian interpretation. Moreover, we show that it is not in conflict with the traditional Occam's razor that Bayesian models possess, in that they tend to prefer simpler models when possible. We illustrate the approach with an example of Bayesian model selection in neural networks. Finally, we conclude with directions for future research.",

Yet office hours, at times, remain an untapped source of academic support. The current study examined whether office hour attendance in combination with a learning reflection would help students learn material in an introductory statistics course. Psychology students were randomly assigned to meet in person with the course instructor and complete a learning reflection form prior to a test. Students who completed these tasks prior to the second test in the course outperformed other students. Office hour attendance combined with reflection may be a useful way to improve students’ understanding of statistics. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)",

Self-advocacy is defined as communicating individual wants, needs, and rights to determine and pursue required accommodations. While self-advocacy is linked to academic success, little is known about how students with disabilities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) practice self-advocacy. We previously developed a model of self-advocacy for STEM students with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and/or specific learning disabilities (SLD). Here, we use this model to examine what factors support or hinder self-advocacy in undergraduate STEM courses. We conducted semistructured interviews with 25 STEM majors with ADHD and/or SLD and used qualitative approaches to analyze our data. We found internal factors, or factors within a participant, and external factors, the situations and people, described by our participants, that influenced self-advocacy. These factors often interacted and functioned as a support or barrier, depending on the individuals and their unique experiences. We developed a model to understand how factors supported or hindered self-advocacy in STEM. Supporting factors contributed to a sense of comfort and security for our participants and informed their perceptions that accommodation use was accepted in a STEM course. We share implications for research and teaching based on our results.",

This is usually the case in digital pathology, which consists of gigapixel sized images. While deterministic attention-based MIL approaches achieve strong bag-level performance, they often overlook the uncertainty inherent in instance relevance. In this paper, we address the lack of uncertainty quantification in instance-level attention scores by introducing \\textbf{SGPMIL}, a new probabilistic attention-based MIL framework grounded in Sparse Gaussian Processes (SGP). By learning a posterior distribution over attention scores, SGPMIL enables principled uncertainty estimation, resulting in more reliable and calibrated instance relevance maps. Our approach not only preserves competitive bag-level performance but also significantly improves the quality and interpretability of instance-level predictions under uncertainty. SGPMIL extends prior work by introducing feature scaling in the SGP predictive mean function, leading to faster training, improved efficiency, and enhanced instance-level performance. Extensive experiments on multiple well-established digital pathology datasets highlight the effectiveness of our approach across both bag- and instance-level evaluations. Our code will be made publicly available.",

A systematic review and meta-analyses The regulation of motivation is considered a key aspect of self-regulated learning (SRL) as it is presumed that maintaining an adequate level of motivation is essential for engagement, effort and persistence in academic tasks. In this review, we aimed to improve our understanding of motivational regulation strategies, their supposed antecedents and the educational implications. A search was conducted in Web of Science, Scopus, PsycInfo, and ERIC databases. Of 4027 records identified, 64 (75 studies) were deemed eligible after inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied and studies with low methodological quality were discarded. Data on 18 different motivational regulation strategies were available. Extrinsic/controlling types of strategies were reported to be used more frequently than intrinsic/autonomous strategies. Motivational regulation strategies were significantly associated with metamotivational beliefs, academic skills and adjustment. Available evidence supports assumptions of theoretical models on antecedents and academic implications of motivational self-regulation. Educational impact and implications statement The present study provides a compendium of the different motivational self-regulation strategies studied to date, describes the nature of these and unifies the different denominations used. The available evidence on the frequency of use of the different strategies that has been collected may be useful for educators, enabling them to anticipate and adapt to the status of the different motivational facets in students. Drawing on theoretical models of motivational self-regulation, the interconnections between the use of the strategies and their supposed antecedents and the expected educational implications were explored. This will provide researchers and educators with an interpretive framework to draw upon when adapting to interindividual diversity in strategy use and when assessing the compatibility between educational practices and the efficient use and training of motivational strategies.",

One crucial aspect for this progress are novel neural architectures. Currently employed architectures have mostly been developed manually by human experts, which is a time-consuming and error-prone process. Because of this, there is growing interest in automated neural architecture search methods. We provide an overview of existing work in this field of research and categorize them according to three dimensions: search space, search strategy, and performance estimation strategy.",

          "input_text": "Ensemble of Weak Spectral Total Variation Learners: a PET-CT Case Study Solving computer vision problems through machine learning, one often encounters lack of sufficient training data. To mitigate this we propose the use of ensembles of weak learners based on spectral total-variation (STV) features (Gilboa 2014). The features are related to nonlinear eigenfunctions of the total-variation subgradient and can characterize well textures at various scales. It was shown (Burger et-al 2016) that, in the one-dimensional case, orthogonal features are generated, whereas in two-dimensions the features are empirically lowly correlated. Ensemble learning theory advocates the use of lowly correlated weak learners. We thus propose here to design ensembles using learners based on STV features. To show the effectiveness of this paradigm we examine a hard real-world medical imaging problem: the predictive value of computed tomography (CT) data for high uptake in positron emission tomography (PET) for patients suspected of skeletal metastases. The database consists of 457 scans with 1524 unique pairs of registered CT and PET slices. Our approach is compared to deep-learning methods and to Radiomics features, showing STV learners perform best (AUC=0.87), compared to neural nets (AUC=0.75) and Radiomics (AUC=0.79). We observe that fine STV scales in CT images are especially indicative for the presence of high uptake in PET.",

In 1966, Taylor constructed a free resolution for monomial ideals in polynomial rings, which Gemeda later showed admits a differential graded (DG) algebra structure. In 2002, Avramov proved that the Taylor resolution admits a DG algebra structure with divided powers. In 2007, Herzog introduced the generalized Taylor resolution, which is usually smaller than the original Taylor resolution. Recently, in 2023, VandeBogert showed that the generalized Taylor resolution also admits a DG algebra structure. In this paper, we extend Avramov's result by proving that the generalized Taylor resolution admits a DG algebra structure with divided powers. Along the way, we correct a sign error in VandeBogert's product formula. We provide applications concerning homotopy Lie algebras and resolutions of squarefree monomial ideals.",

Psychology students were randomly assigned to meet in person with the course instructor and complete a learning reflection form prior to a test. Students who completed these tasks prior to the second test in the course outperformed other students. Office hour attendance combined with reflection may be a useful way to improve students’ understanding of statistics. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)",

Large models offer a solution via data generation. Nonetheless, real-world data are obviously more valuable comparing to artificially intelligence generated data, particularly in constructing image datasets. For this reason, we propose a novel method for auto-constructing datasets from real-world images by a multiagent collaborative system, named as DatasetAgent. By coordinating four different agents equipped with Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), as well as a tool package for image optimization, DatasetAgent is able to construct high-quality image datasets according to user-specified requirements. In particular, two types of experiments are conducted, including expanding existing datasets and creating new ones from scratch, on a variety of open-source datasets. In both cases, multiple image datasets constructed by DatasetAgent are used to train various vision models for image classification, object detection, and image segmentation.",

Therefore, effectively compressing SAMs has become an increasingly pressing practical need. In this study, we propose Birkhoff, a novel data-free compression algorithm for SAM and its variants. Unlike quantization, pruning, distillation, and other compression methods, Birkhoff embodies versatility across model types, agility in deployment, faithfulness to the original model, and compactness in model size. Specifically, Birkhoff introduces a novel compression algorithm: Hyper-Compression, whose core principle is to find a dense trajectory to turn a high-dimensional parameter vector into a low-dimensional scalar. Furthermore, Birkhoff designs a dedicated linear layer operator, HyperLinear, to fuse decompression and matrix multiplication to significantly accelerate inference of the compressed SAMs. Extensive experiments on 18 SAMs in the COCO, LVIS, and SA-1B datasets show that Birkhoff performs consistently and competitively in compression time, compression ratio, post-compression performance, and inference speed. For example, Birkhoff can achieve a compression ratio of 5.17x on SAM2-B, with less than 1% performance drop without using any fine-tuning data. Moreover, the compression is finished within 60 seconds for all models.",

Recent advancements have primarily focused on refining voxel-level features to construct 3D scenes. However, treating voxels as the basic interaction units inherently limits the utilization of class-level information, which is proven critical for enhancing the granularity of completion results. To address this, we propose \\textbf{D}isentangling Instance and Scene Contexts (DISC), a novel dual-stream paradigm that enhances learning for both instance and scene categories through separated optimization. Specifically, we replace voxel queries with discriminative class queries, which incorporate class-specific geometric and semantic priors. Additionally, we exploit the intrinsic properties of classes to design specialized decoding modules, facilitating targeted interactions and efficient class-level information flow. Experimental results demonstrate that DISC achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on both SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360 benchmarks, with mIoU scores of 17.35 and 20.55, respectively. Remarkably, DISC even outperforms multi-frame SOTA methods using only single-frame input and significantly improves instance category performance, surpassing both single-frame and multi-frame SOTA instance mIoU by 17.9\\% and 11.9\\%, respectively, on the SemanticKITTI hidden test.

However, current publicly available datasets exhibit limitations, such as overly simplistic scenarios, low-resolution footage, and insufficiently diverse conditions, creating a considerable gap between academic research and real-world scenario. To fill this gap, we introduce RoundaboutHD, a comprehensive, high-resolution multi-camera vehicle tracking benchmark dataset specifically designed to represent real-world roundabout scenarios. RoundaboutHD provides a total of 40 minutes of labelled video footage captured by four non-overlapping, high-resolution (4K resolution, 15 fps) cameras. In total, 512 unique vehicle identities are annotated across different camera views, offering rich cross-camera association data. RoundaboutHD offers temporal consistency video footage and enhanced challenges, including increased occlusions and nonlinear movement inside the roundabout. In addition to the full MCVT dataset, several subsets are also available for object detection, single camera tracking, and image-based vehicle re-identification (ReID) tasks. Vehicle model information and camera modelling/ geometry information are also included to support further analysis. We provide baseline results for vehicle detection, single-camera tracking, image-based vehicle re-identification, and multi-camera tracking.

Over-parameterized models such as deep neural networks have an interesting re-descending property in their risk characteristics. This is a recent phenomenon in machine learning and has been the subject of many studies. As the complexity of the model increases, there is a U-shaped region corresponding to the traditional bias-variance trade-off, but then as the number of parameters equals the number of observations and the model becomes one of interpolation, the risk can become infinite and then, in the over-parameterized region, it re-descends -- the double descent effect. We show that this has a natural Bayesian interpretation. Moreover, we show that it is not in conflict with the traditional Occam's razor that Bayesian models possess, in that they tend to prefer simpler models when possible. We illustrate the approach with an example of Bayesian model selection in neural networks. Finally, we conclude with directions for future research.",

However, 7T scanners are costly, scarce, and introduce additional challenges such as susceptibility artifacts. We propose an efficient transformer-based model (7T-Restormer) to synthesize 7T-quality T1-maps from routine 1.5T or 3T T1-weighted (T1W) images. Methods: Our model was validated on 35 1.5T and 108 3T T1w MRI paired with corresponding 7T T1 maps of patients with confirmed MS. A total of 141 patient cases (32,128 slices) were randomly divided into 105 (25; 80) training cases (19,204 slices), 19 (5; 14) validation cases (3,476 slices), and 17 (5; 14) test cases (3,145 slices) where (X; Y) denotes the patients with 1.5T and 3T T1W scans, respectively. The synthetic 7T T1 maps were compared against the ResViT and ResShift models. Results: The 7T-Restormer model achieved a PSNR of 26.0 +/- 4.6 dB, SSIM of 0.861 +/- 0.072, and NMSE of 0.019 +/- 0.011 for 1.5T inputs, and 25.9 +/- 4.9 dB, and 0.866 +/- 0.077 for 3T inputs, respectively. Using 10.5 M parameters, our model reduced NMSE by 64 % relative to 56.7M parameter ResShift (0.019 vs 0.052, p = <.001 and by 41 % relative to 70.4M parameter ResViT (0.019 vs 0.032, p = <.001) at 1.5T, with similar advantages at 3T (0.021 vs 0.060 and 0.033; p < .001). Training with a mixed 1.5 T + 3 T corpus was superior to single-field strategies. Restricting the model to 1.5T increased the 1.5T NMSE from 0.019 to 0.021 (p = 1.1E-3) while training solely on 3T resulted in lower performance on input 1.5T T1W MRI. Conclusion: We propose a novel method for predicting quantitative 7T MP2RAGE maps from 1.5T and 3T T1W scans with higher quality than existing state-of-the-art methods. Our approach makes the benefits of 7T MRI more accessible to standard clinical workflows.",

The current study aimed to examine the temporal relations among expectancies, task values (intrinsic and utility value), and perceived costs (emotional and effort cost) in math to understand the underlying motivational processes for math-related career intention and achievement among middle school girls. To this end, we collected responses from 638 Korean middle school girls three separate times within a year. The autoregressive cross-lagged results revealed that there was no reciprocal relationship between expectancies and task values, but there appeared to be unidirectional positive prediction paths from utility value to self-efficacy. Regarding the costs, there were reciprocal relations between intrinsic value and emotional cost, which negatively affected each other. Consequently, utility value indirectly enhanced girls' math achievement by fostering self-efficacy, whereas emotional cost indirectly hindered their career intentions in math by dampening their intrinsic value. These findings suggest that it is important not only to increase task values, but also to manage costs to help adolescent girls adhere to their math-related career goals.",

However, existing deep learning-based methods face two major challenges: 1) They predominantly adopt a flat classification paradigm, which limits their ability to generate end-to-end multi-granularity hierarchical predictions aligned with tree-structured hierarchies used in practice. 2) Most cross-domain studies focus on performance degradation caused by sensor or scene variations, with limited attention to transferring LCLU models to cross-domain tasks with heterogeneous hierarchies (e.g., LCLU to crop classification). These limitations hinder the flexibility and generalization of LCLU models in practical applications. To address these challenges, we propose HieraRS, a novel hierarchical interpretation paradigm that enables multi-granularity predictions and supports the efficient transfer of LCLU models to cross-domain tasks with heterogeneous tree-structured hierarchies. We introduce the Bidirectional Hierarchical Consistency Constraint Mechanism (BHCCM), which can be seamlessly integrated into mainstream flat classification models to generate hierarchical predictions, while improving both semantic consistency and classification accuracy. Furthermore, we present TransLU, a dual-branch cross-domain transfer framework comprising two key components: Cross-Domain Knowledge Sharing (CDKS) and Cross-Domain Semantic Alignment (CDSA). TransLU supports dynamic category expansion and facilitates the effective adaptation of LCLU models to heterogeneous hierarchies. In addition, we construct MM-5B, a large-scale multi-modal hierarchical land use dataset featuring pixel-wise annotations.

Several studies have shown that the performance of these 3D perception methods can be further enhanced by combining sequential BEV features obtained from multiple camera frames. However, even after compensating for the ego-motion of an autonomous agent, the performance gain from temporal aggregation is limited when combining a large number of image frames. This limitation arises due to dynamic changes in BEV features over time caused by object motion. In this paper, we introduce a novel temporal 3D perception method called OnlineBEV, which combines BEV features over time using a recurrent structure. This structure increases the effective number of combined features with minimal memory usage. However, it is critical to spatially align the features over time to maintain strong performance. OnlineBEV employs the Motion-guided BEV Fusion Network (MBFNet) to achieve temporal feature alignment. MBFNet extracts motion features from consecutive BEV frames and dynamically aligns historical BEV features with current ones using these motion features. To enforce temporal feature alignment explicitly, we use Temporal Consistency Learning Loss, which captures discrepancies between historical and target BEV features. Experiments conducted on the nuScenes benchmark demonstrate that OnlineBEV achieves significant performance gains over the current best method, SOLOFusion. OnlineBEV achieves 63.9% NDS on the nuScenes test set, recording state-of-the-art performance in the camera-only 3D object detection task.",

Little research, however, has investigated how generating analogies can support college students’ self-regulated learning (SRL) of biology. This study therefore evaluated a contextualized cognitive learning strategy intervention designed to teach students to generate analogies as a learning strategy to aid learning within a university biology course. Participants (n = 179) were taught how to generate analogies as a learning strategy to learn about plant and animal physiology. We hypothesized the quality of students’ generated analogies would increase over time, and their analogical reasoning, knowledge of cognition (KOC; a component of metacognitive awareness), and course performance would be higher after intervention, controlling for associated pre-intervention values. Regression analyses and repeated-measures analysis of variance indicated a positive relationship between generated-analogy quality and analogical reasoning, and increased analogy quality after intervention. No change in reported KOC was observed, and analogy quality did not predict course performance. Findings extend understanding of strategies that can support college students’ biology learning. Researchers and practitioners can leverage our approach to teaching analogies in their own research and classrooms to support students’ SRL, analogical reasoning, and learning.",

While ample research has highlighted the positive associations of expectancy beliefs and task values with academic achievement, research on students' perceived costs is in its infancy. We investigated the temporal interrelations among expectancies, task values and different types of perceived cost, the role of these constructs in biology achievement, and the role of perceived costs as a moderator in the relations of expectancy beliefs to biology achievement. A cross-lagged path analysis of semester-long data from 234 undergraduate biology students pointed to variable relations among expectancies, task values, perceived costs, and biology achievement. For example, while early expectancy beliefs related to later attainment and interest value, early task values and perceived costs did not relate to later expectancy beliefs. Furthermore, early attainment value related to later effort and opportunity cost. Expectancy beliefs and effort and opportunity cost in biology were associated with final biology grade. Finally, effort cost moderated the relations between expectancy beliefs and students' final grades. These findings provide evidence for the dynamic relations among perceived costs, task values, and expectancy beliefs over a semester and point to the interplay between expectancies and perceived costs in their relation to academic achievement in science.",

This is of concern because excessive anxiety can decrease student performance. Levels and sources of student anxiety in three introductory biology lecture classes were investigated via an online survey and student interviews. The survey (n = 327) data revealed that 16% of students had moderately high classroom anxiety, which differed among the three classes. All five active learning classroom practices that were investigated caused student anxiety, with students voluntarily answering a question or being called on to answer a question causing higher anxiety than working in groups, completing worksheets, or answering clicker questions. Interviews revealed that student anxiety seemed to align with communication apprehension, social anxiety, and test anxiety. Additionally, students with higher general anxiety were more likely to self-report lower course grade and the intention to leave the major. These data suggest that a subset of students in introductory biology experience anxiety in response to active learning, and its potential impacts should be investigated.",

To mitigate this we propose the use of ensembles of weak learners based on spectral total-variation (STV) features (Gilboa 2014). The features are related to nonlinear eigenfunctions of the total-variation subgradient and can characterize well textures at various scales. It was shown (Burger et-al 2016) that, in the one-dimensional case, orthogonal features are generated, whereas in two-dimensions the features are empirically lowly correlated. Ensemble learning theory advocates the use of lowly correlated weak learners. We thus propose here to design ensembles using learners based on STV features. To show the effectiveness of this paradigm we examine a hard real-world medical imaging problem: the predictive value of computed tomography (CT) data for high uptake in positron emission tomography (PET) for patients suspected of skeletal metastases. The database consists of 457 scans with 1524 unique pairs of registered CT and PET slices. Our approach is compared to deep-learning methods and to Radiomics features, showing STV learners perform best (AUC=0.87), compared to neural nets (AUC=0.75) and Radiomics (AUC=0.79). We observe that fine STV scales in CT images are especially indicative for the presence of high uptake in PET.",

Sample & methods Undergraduate students (N = 152) learned from a video-recorded lecture, and then engaged in follow-up learning activities involving retrieval practice, restudy, elaboration, or a combination of retrieval practice with elaboration. We ensured that initial retrieval success was high and that all groups had the same expectations about the nature of content to be tested. We assessed both factual knowledge and comprehension, as well as the respective indicators of metacognitive-monitoring accuracy (metamemory, metacomprehension). We assessed self-efficacy and situational interest as motivational variables. Results In a one-week-delayed posttest, elaboration improved factual knowledge and comprehension. This pattern held whether learners just elaborated or additionally engaged in retrieval practice. Having students self-generate their own examples during retrieval practice improved comprehension, but merely letting students retrieve experimenter-provided examples did not. Students' self-reported mental effort mediated the factual knowledge benefits of retrieval practice. The number of students’ self-generated elaborations mediated comprehension benefits. Students engaging in constructive retrieval while learning revealed the highest metacognitive-monitoring accuracy in factual knowledge and comprehension. We found no differences between conditions regarding situational interest and self-efficacy. Motivation to reuse the respective learning strategies was higher in all conditions compared to restudy. Conclusion Constructive retrieval seems advantageous when considering its benefits on learning outcomes and metacognition. When working on retrieval tasks, students only profited from self-generated, but not from provided, examples with respect to comprehension.",

Recent advancements have primarily focused on refining voxel-level features to construct 3D scenes. However, treating voxels as the basic interaction units inherently limits the utilization of class-level information, which is proven critical for enhancing the granularity of completion results. To address this, we propose \\textbf{D}isentangling Instance and Scene Contexts (DISC), a novel dual-stream paradigm that enhances learning for both instance and scene categories through separated optimization. Specifically, we replace voxel queries with discriminative class queries, which incorporate class-specific geometric and semantic priors. Additionally, we exploit the intrinsic properties of classes to design specialized decoding modules, facilitating targeted interactions and efficient class-level information flow. Experimental results demonstrate that DISC achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on both SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360 benchmarks, with mIoU scores of 17.35 and 20.55, respectively. Remarkably, DISC even outperforms multi-frame SOTA methods using only single-frame input and significantly improves instance category performance, surpassing both single-frame and multi-frame SOTA instance mIoU by 17.9\\% and 11.9\\%, respectively, on the SemanticKITTI hidden test.

          "input_text": "Compress Any Segment Anything Model (SAM) Due to the excellent performance in yielding high-quality, zero-shot segmentation, Segment Anything Model (SAM) and its variants have been widely applied in diverse scenarios such as healthcare and intelligent manufacturing. Therefore, effectively compressing SAMs has become an increasingly pressing practical need. In this study, we propose Birkhoff, a novel data-free compression algorithm for SAM and its variants. Unlike quantization, pruning, distillation, and other compression methods, Birkhoff embodies versatility across model types, agility in deployment, faithfulness to the original model, and compactness in model size. Specifically, Birkhoff introduces a novel compression algorithm: Hyper-Compression, whose core principle is to find a dense trajectory to turn a high-dimensional parameter vector into a low-dimensional scalar. Furthermore, Birkhoff designs a dedicated linear layer operator, HyperLinear, to fuse decompression and matrix multiplication to significantly accelerate inference of the compressed SAMs. Extensive experiments on 18 SAMs in the COCO, LVIS, and SA-1B datasets show that Birkhoff performs consistently and competitively in compression time, compression ratio, post-compression performance, and inference speed. For example, Birkhoff can achieve a compression ratio of 5.17x on SAM2-B, with less than 1% performance drop without using any fine-tuning data. Moreover, the compression is finished within 60 seconds for all models.",

A systematic review and meta-analyses The regulation of motivation is considered a key aspect of self-regulated learning (SRL) as it is presumed that maintaining an adequate level of motivation is essential for engagement, effort and persistence in academic tasks. In this review, we aimed to improve our understanding of motivational regulation strategies, their supposed antecedents and the educational implications. A search was conducted in Web of Science, Scopus, PsycInfo, and ERIC databases. Of 4027 records identified, 64 (75 studies) were deemed eligible after inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied and studies with low methodological quality were discarded. Data on 18 different motivational regulation strategies were available. Extrinsic/controlling types of strategies were reported to be used more frequently than intrinsic/autonomous strategies. Motivational regulation strategies were significantly associated with metamotivational beliefs, academic skills and adjustment. Available evidence supports assumptions of theoretical models on antecedents and academic implications of motivational self-regulation. Educational impact and implications statement The present study provides a compendium of the different motivational self-regulation strategies studied to date, describes the nature of these and unifies the different denominations used. The available evidence on the frequency of use of the different strategies that has been collected may be useful for educators, enabling them to anticipate and adapt to the status of the different motivational facets in students. Drawing on theoretical models of motivational self-regulation, the interconnections between the use of the strategies and their supposed antecedents and the expected educational implications were explored. This will provide researchers and educators with an interpretive framework to draw upon when adapting to interindividual diversity in strategy use and when assessing the compatibility between educational practices and the efficient use and training of motivational strategies.",

Large models offer a solution via data generation. Nonetheless, real-world data are obviously more valuable comparing to artificially intelligence generated data, particularly in constructing image datasets. For this reason, we propose a novel method for auto-constructing datasets from real-world images by a multiagent collaborative system, named as DatasetAgent. By coordinating four different agents equipped with Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), as well as a tool package for image optimization, DatasetAgent is able to construct high-quality image datasets according to user-specified requirements. In particular, two types of experiments are conducted, including expanding existing datasets and creating new ones from scratch, on a variety of open-source datasets. In both cases, multiple image datasets constructed by DatasetAgent are used to train various vision models for image classification, object detection, and image segmentation.",

To address computational demands, Sequential Monte Carlo Squared (SMC$^2$) is well-suited for high-performance computing (HPC) environments. The design of the proposal distribution within SMC$^2$ can improve accuracy and exploration of the posterior as poor proposals may lead to high variance in importance weights and particle degeneracy. The Metropolis-Adjusted Langevin Algorithm (MALA) uses gradient information so that particles preferentially explore regions of higher probability. In this paper, we extend this idea by incorporating second-order information, specifically the Hessian of the log-target. While second-order proposals have been explored previously in particle Markov Chain Monte Carlo (p-MCMC) methods, we are the first to introduce them within the SMC$^2$ framework. Second-order proposals not only use the gradient (first-order derivative), but also the curvature (second-order derivative) of the target distribution. Experimental results on synthetic models highlight the benefits of our approach in terms of step-size selection and posterior approximation accuracy when compared to other proposals.",

In 1966, Taylor constructed a free resolution for monomial ideals in polynomial rings, which Gemeda later showed admits a differential graded (DG) algebra structure. In 2002, Avramov proved that the Taylor resolution admits a DG algebra structure with divided powers. In 2007, Herzog introduced the generalized Taylor resolution, which is usually smaller than the original Taylor resolution. Recently, in 2023, VandeBogert showed that the generalized Taylor resolution also admits a DG algebra structure. In this paper, we extend Avramov's result by proving that the generalized Taylor resolution admits a DG algebra structure with divided powers. Along the way, we correct a sign error in VandeBogert's product formula. We provide applications concerning homotopy Lie algebras and resolutions of squarefree monomial ideals.",

Empirical Insights into Undergraduate Life Science Majors' Emotions about Mathematics Undergraduate life science majors are reputed to have negative emotions toward mathematics, yet little empirical evidence supports this. We sought to compare emotions of majors in the life sciences versus other natural sciences and math. We adapted the Attitudes toward the Subject of Chemistry Inventory to create an Attitudes toward the Subject of Mathematics Inventory (ASMI). We collected data from 359 science and math majors at two research universities and conducted a series of statistical tests that indicated that four AMSI items comprised a reasonable measure of students' emotional satisfaction with math. We then compared life science and non-life science majors and found that major had a small to moderate relationship with students' responses. Gender also had a small relationship with students' responses, while students' race, ethnicity, and year in school had no observable relationship. Using latent profile analysis, we identified three groups-students who were emotionally satisfied with math, emotionally dissatisfied with math, and neutral. These results and the emotional satisfaction with math scale should be useful for identifying differences in other undergraduate populations, determining the malleability of undergraduates' emotional satisfaction with math, and testing effects of interventions aimed at improving life science majors' attitudes toward math.",

This study investigated how gender and SES related to achievement mediated by expectancy of success, STV, and their interaction. The sample consisted of 396 participants in their final year of upper secondary education. Self-report measures were completed of expectancy, STV, gender and socio-economic indicators. These were linked to exit examination grades (A Levels). Only parental education was directly related to achievement however gender and SES were indirectly linked to student grades through expectancy, STV, and the expectancy-STV interaction. Males, students with a higher level of parental education, and students from households with a higher number of possessions, all performed better in their examination due to higher expectations; higher STV amplified these relations. Gender and SES differences in achievement can be partly explained by psychological factors, namely students’ expectations of success and STV.",

Its ability to capture intrinsic similarities and differences among data samples has led to state-of-the-art results in computer vision tasks. These strengths make CL particularly well-suited for Earth System Observation (ESO), where diverse satellite modalities such as optical and SAR imagery offer naturally aligned views of the same geospatial regions. However, ESO presents unique challenges, including high inter-class similarity, scene clutter, and ambiguous boundaries, which complicate representation learning -- especially in low-label, multi-label settings. Existing CL frameworks often focus on intra-modality self-supervision or lack mechanisms for multi-label alignment and semantic precision across modalities. In this work, we introduce MoSAiC, a unified framework that jointly optimizes intra- and inter-modality contrastive learning with a multi-label supervised contrastive loss. Designed specifically for multi-modal satellite imagery, MoSAiC enables finer semantic disentanglement and more robust representation learning across spectrally similar and spatially complex classes. Experiments on two benchmark datasets, BigEarthNet V2.0 and Sent12MS, show that MoSAiC consistently outperforms both fully supervised and self-supervised baselines in terms of accuracy, cluster coherence, and generalization in low-label and high-class-overlap scenarios.",

The current study aimed to examine the temporal relations among expectancies, task values (intrinsic and utility value), and perceived costs (emotional and effort cost) in math to understand the underlying motivational processes for math-related career intention and achievement among middle school girls. To this end, we collected responses from 638 Korean middle school girls three separate times within a year. The autoregressive cross-lagged results revealed that there was no reciprocal relationship between expectancies and task values, but there appeared to be unidirectional positive prediction paths from utility value to self-efficacy. Regarding the costs, there were reciprocal relations between intrinsic value and emotional cost, which negatively affected each other. Consequently, utility value indirectly enhanced girls' math achievement by fostering self-efficacy, whereas emotional cost indirectly hindered their career intentions in math by dampening their intrinsic value. These findings suggest that it is important not only to increase task values, but also to manage costs to help adolescent girls adhere to their math-related career goals.",

CLiFT enables compute-efficient rendering by compressed tokens, while being capable of changing the number of tokens to represent a scene or render a novel view with one trained network. Concretely, given a set of images, multi-view encoder tokenizes the images with the camera poses. Latent-space K-means selects a reduced set of rays as cluster centroids using the tokens. The multi-view ``condenser'' compresses the information of all the tokens into the centroid tokens to construct CLiFTs. At test time, given a target view and a compute budget (i.e., the number of CLiFTs), the system collects the specified number of nearby tokens and synthesizes a novel view using a compute-adaptive renderer. Extensive experiments on RealEstate10K and DL3DV datasets quantitatively and qualitatively validate our approach, achieving significant data reduction with comparable rendering quality and the highest overall rendering score, while providing trade-offs of data size, rendering quality, and rendering speed.",

We examined whether two psychological variables, social anxiety (psychological distress relating to the fear of negative evaluation by others) and academic self-efficacy (confidence in one's ability to overcome academic challenges), interact with student perceptions of evidence-based instructional practices (EBIPs) and associate with their final grades in a STEM-related course. Human anatomy and physiology students in community college courses rated various EBIPs for their perceived educational value and their capacity to elicit anxiety (N = 227). In general, practices causing students the most anxiety (e.g., cold calling) were reported by students as having the least educational value. When controlling for students' self-reported grade point averages, socially anxious students rated several EBIPs as more anxiety inducing, whereas high-efficacy students reported less anxiety surrounding other EBIPs. Furthermore, mediation analysis revealed that individual differences in academic self-efficacy at the beginning of the term explained some of the negative association between students' social anxiety levels and final grades in the course. Our results, obtained in a community college context, support a growing body of evidence that social anxiety and academic self-efficacy are linked with how students perceive and perform in an active-learning environment.",

L-CLIPScore is calculated from a lightweight CLIP (L-CLIP), which is a dual-encoder architecture compressed and distilled from CLIP. To compress, we apply two powerful techniques which are weight multiplexing and matrix decomposition for reducing the parameters of encoders and word embedding matrix, respectively. To distill, we design a novel multi-modal Similarity Regulator (SR) loss to transfer more vision-language alignment knowledge. Specifically, SR loss amplifies the multi-modal embedding similarity if the given image-text pair is matched and diminishes the similarity if the pair is non-matched. By compressing and distilling by this novel SR loss, our L-CLIP achieves comparable multi-modal alignment ability to the original CLIP while it requires fewer computation resources and running time. We carry out exhaustive experiments to validate the efficiency and effectiveness of L-CLIPScore when using it as the judge to evaluate caption quality. We also discover that when using L-CLIPScore as the supervisor to train the captioning model, it should be mixed up by an n-gram-based metric and meanwhile analyze why using L-CLIPScore only will cause fail training.",

Curricular reform efforts in QR have been directed at disseminating course design and pedagogy but less work has been directed at understanding what faculty at large view as crucial for student success in their courses. We conducted semi-structured interviews of 15 faculty teaching in an introductory biology course sequence to determine (1) what participants viewed as QR competencies crucial for student success, and (2) their perceptions of student preparedness for QR in context. Participant responses fell into four categories (Quantitative Reasoning, Process of Science, Modeling, and Affective Factors) which largely align with competencies called for in recent publications. Additionally, participants noted that many students lacked these QR competencies upon matriculation. Characterization of QR skills crucial for success can help guide curricular reform not only in biology, but also in the context of other STEM disciplines.",

The model is trained on a large-scale dataset of Ubuntu XFCE recordings, which include both randomly generated interactions and realistic interactions produced by AI agents. Experiments show that NeuralOS successfully renders realistic GUI sequences, accurately captures mouse interactions, and reliably predicts state transitions like application launches. Although modeling fine-grained keyboard interactions precisely remains challenging, NeuralOS offers a step toward creating fully adaptive, generative neural interfaces for future human-computer interaction systems.",

Several studies have shown that the performance of these 3D perception methods can be further enhanced by combining sequential BEV features obtained from multiple camera frames. However, even after compensating for the ego-motion of an autonomous agent, the performance gain from temporal aggregation is limited when combining a large number of image frames. This limitation arises due to dynamic changes in BEV features over time caused by object motion. In this paper, we introduce a novel temporal 3D perception method called OnlineBEV, which combines BEV features over time using a recurrent structure. This structure increases the effective number of combined features with minimal memory usage. However, it is critical to spatially align the features over time to maintain strong performance. OnlineBEV employs the Motion-guided BEV Fusion Network (MBFNet) to achieve temporal feature alignment. MBFNet extracts motion features from consecutive BEV frames and dynamically aligns historical BEV features with current ones using these motion features. To enforce temporal feature alignment explicitly, we use Temporal Consistency Learning Loss, which captures discrepancies between historical and target BEV features. Experiments conducted on the nuScenes benchmark demonstrate that OnlineBEV achieves significant performance gains over the current best method, SOLOFusion. OnlineBEV achieves 63.9% NDS on the nuScenes test set, recording state-of-the-art performance in the camera-only 3D object detection task.",

While hurricane preparedness and response strategies vastly rely on the accuracy and timeliness of the predicted households' evacuation decisions, current studies featuring psychological-driven linear models leave some significant limitations in practice. Hence, the present study proposes a new methodology for predicting households' evacuation decisions constructed by easily accessible demographic and resource-related predictors compared to current models with a high reliance on psychological factors. Meanwhile, an enhanced logistic regression (ELR) model that could automatically account for nonlinearities (i.e., univariate and bivariate threshold effects) by an interpretable machine learning approach is developed to secure the accuracy of the results. Specifically, low-depth decision trees are selected for nonlinearity detection to identify the critical thresholds, build a transparent model structure, and solidify the robustness. Then, an empirical dataset collected after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita is hired to examine the practicability of the new methodology. The results indicate that the enhanced logistic regression (ELR) model has the most convincing performance in explaining the variation of the households' evacuation decision in model fit and prediction capability compared to previous linear models. It suggests that the proposed methodology could provide a new tool and framework for the emergency management authorities to improve the estimation of evacuation traffic demands in a timely and accurate manner.",

Over-parameterized models such as deep neural networks have an interesting re-descending property in their risk characteristics. This is a recent phenomenon in machine learning and has been the subject of many studies. As the complexity of the model increases, there is a U-shaped region corresponding to the traditional bias-variance trade-off, but then as the number of parameters equals the number of observations and the model becomes one of interpolation, the risk can become infinite and then, in the over-parameterized region, it re-descends -- the double descent effect. We show that this has a natural Bayesian interpretation. Moreover, we show that it is not in conflict with the traditional Occam's razor that Bayesian models possess, in that they tend to prefer simpler models when possible. We illustrate the approach with an example of Bayesian model selection in neural networks. Finally, we conclude with directions for future research.",

Yet office hours, at times, remain an untapped source of academic support. The current study examined whether office hour attendance in combination with a learning reflection would help students learn material in an introductory statistics course. Psychology students were randomly assigned to meet in person with the course instructor and complete a learning reflection form prior to a test. Students who completed these tasks prior to the second test in the course outperformed other students. Office hour attendance combined with reflection may be a useful way to improve students’ understanding of statistics. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)",

Self-advocacy is defined as communicating individual wants, needs, and rights to determine and pursue required accommodations. While self-advocacy is linked to academic success, little is known about how students with disabilities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) practice self-advocacy. We previously developed a model of self-advocacy for STEM students with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and/or specific learning disabilities (SLD). Here, we use this model to examine what factors support or hinder self-advocacy in undergraduate STEM courses. We conducted semistructured interviews with 25 STEM majors with ADHD and/or SLD and used qualitative approaches to analyze our data. We found internal factors, or factors within a participant, and external factors, the situations and people, described by our participants, that influenced self-advocacy. These factors often interacted and functioned as a support or barrier, depending on the individuals and their unique experiences. We developed a model to understand how factors supported or hindered self-advocacy in STEM. Supporting factors contributed to a sense of comfort and security for our participants and informed their perceptions that accommodation use was accepted in a STEM course. We share implications for research and teaching based on our results.",

This is usually the case in digital pathology, which consists of gigapixel sized images. While deterministic attention-based MIL approaches achieve strong bag-level performance, they often overlook the uncertainty inherent in instance relevance. In this paper, we address the lack of uncertainty quantification in instance-level attention scores by introducing \\textbf{SGPMIL}, a new probabilistic attention-based MIL framework grounded in Sparse Gaussian Processes (SGP). By learning a posterior distribution over attention scores, SGPMIL enables principled uncertainty estimation, resulting in more reliable and calibrated instance relevance maps. Our approach not only preserves competitive bag-level performance but also significantly improves the quality and interpretability of instance-level predictions under uncertainty. SGPMIL extends prior work by introducing feature scaling in the SGP predictive mean function, leading to faster training, improved efficiency, and enhanced instance-level performance. Extensive experiments on multiple well-established digital pathology datasets highlight the effectiveness of our approach across both bag- and instance-level evaluations. Our code will be made publicly available.",

A systematic review and meta-analyses The regulation of motivation is considered a key aspect of self-regulated learning (SRL) as it is presumed that maintaining an adequate level of motivation is essential for engagement, effort and persistence in academic tasks.

Of 4027 records identified, 64 (75 studies) were deemed eligible after inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied and studies with low methodological quality were discarded. Data on 18 different motivational regulation strategies were available. Extrinsic/controlling types of strategies were reported to be used more frequently than intrinsic/autonomous strategies. Motivational regulation strategies were significantly associated with metamotivational beliefs, academic skills and adjustment. Available evidence supports assumptions of theoretical models on antecedents and academic implications of motivational self-regulation. Educational impact and implications statement The present study provides a compendium of the different motivational self-regulation strategies studied to date, describes the nature of these and unifies the different denominations used. The available evidence on the frequency of use of the different strategies that has been collected may be useful for educators, enabling them to anticipate and adapt to the status of the different motivational facets in students. Drawing on theoretical models of motivational self-regulation, the interconnections between the use of the strategies and their supposed antecedents and the expected educational implications were explored.

In this review, we aimed to improve our understanding of motivational regulation strategies, their supposed antecedents and the educational implications.

Of 4027 records identified, 64 (75 studies) were deemed eligible after inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied and studies with low methodological quality were discarded. Data on 18 different motivational regulation strategies were available. Extrinsic/controlling types of strategies were reported to be used more frequently than intrinsic/autonomous strategies. Motivational regulation strategies were significantly associated with metamotivational beliefs, academic skills and adjustment.

Educational impact and implications statement The present study provides a compendium of the different motivational self-regulation strategies studied to date, describes the nature of these and unifies the different denominations used. The available evidence on the frequency of use of the different strategies that has been collected may be useful for educators, enabling them to anticipate and adapt to the status of the different motivational facets in students. Drawing on theoretical models of motivational self-regulation, the interconnections between the use of the strategies and their supposed antecedents and the expected educational implications were explored.

Currently employed architectures have mostly been developed manually by human experts, which is a time-consuming and error-prone process. Because of this, there is growing interest in automated neural architecture search methods. We provide an overview of existing work in this field of research and categorize them according to three dimensions: search space, search strategy, and performance estimation strategy.",

          "input_text": "Ensemble of Weak Spectral Total Variation Learners: a PET-CT Case Study Solving computer vision problems through machine learning, one often encounters lack of sufficient training data. To mitigate this we propose the use of ensembles of weak learners based on spectral total-variation (STV) features (Gilboa 2014). The features are related to nonlinear eigenfunctions of the total-variation subgradient and can characterize well textures at various scales. It was shown (Burger et-al 2016) that, in the one-dimensional case, orthogonal features are generated, whereas in two-dimensions the features are empirically lowly correlated. Ensemble learning theory advocates the use of lowly correlated weak learners. We thus propose here to design ensembles using learners based on STV features. To show the effectiveness of this paradigm we examine a hard real-world medical imaging problem: the predictive value of computed tomography (CT) data for high uptake in positron emission tomography (PET) for patients suspected of skeletal metastases. The database consists of 457 scans with 1524 unique pairs of registered CT and PET slices. Our approach is compared to deep-learning methods and to Radiomics features, showing STV learners perform best (AUC=0.87), compared to neural nets (AUC=0.75) and Radiomics (AUC=0.79). We observe that fine STV scales in CT images are especially indicative for the presence of high uptake in PET.",

In 1966, Taylor constructed a free resolution for monomial ideals in polynomial rings, which Gemeda later showed admits a differential graded (DG) algebra structure. In 2002, Avramov proved that the Taylor resolution admits a DG algebra structure with divided powers. In 2007, Herzog introduced the generalized Taylor resolution, which is usually smaller than the original Taylor resolution. Recently, in 2023, VandeBogert showed that the generalized Taylor resolution also admits a DG algebra structure. In this paper, we extend Avramov's result by proving that the generalized Taylor resolution admits a DG algebra structure with divided powers. Along the way, we correct a sign error in VandeBogert's product formula. We provide applications concerning homotopy Lie algebras and resolutions of squarefree monomial ideals.",

Yet office hours, at times, remain an untapped source of academic support. The current study examined whether office hour attendance in combination with a learning reflection would help students learn material in an introductory statistics course. Psychology students were randomly assigned to meet in person with the course instructor and complete a learning reflection form prior to a test. Students who completed these tasks prior to the second test in the course outperformed other students. Office hour attendance combined with reflection may be a useful way to improve students’ understanding of statistics. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)",

Large models offer a solution via data generation. Nonetheless, real-world data are obviously more valuable comparing to artificially intelligence generated data, particularly in constructing image datasets. For this reason, we propose a novel method for auto-constructing datasets from real-world images by a multiagent collaborative system, named as DatasetAgent. By coordinating four different agents equipped with Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), as well as a tool package for image optimization, DatasetAgent is able to construct high-quality image datasets according to user-specified requirements. In particular, two types of experiments are conducted, including expanding existing datasets and creating new ones from scratch, on a variety of open-source datasets. In both cases, multiple image datasets constructed by DatasetAgent are used to train various vision models for image classification, object detection, and image segmentation.",

Therefore, effectively compressing SAMs has become an increasingly pressing practical need. In this study, we propose Birkhoff, a novel data-free compression algorithm for SAM and its variants. Unlike quantization, pruning, distillation, and other compression methods, Birkhoff embodies versatility across model types, agility in deployment, faithfulness to the original model, and compactness in model size. Specifically, Birkhoff introduces a novel compression algorithm: Hyper-Compression, whose core principle is to find a dense trajectory to turn a high-dimensional parameter vector into a low-dimensional scalar. Furthermore, Birkhoff designs a dedicated linear layer operator, HyperLinear, to fuse decompression and matrix multiplication to significantly accelerate inference of the compressed SAMs. Extensive experiments on 18 SAMs in the COCO, LVIS, and SA-1B datasets show that Birkhoff performs consistently and competitively in compression time, compression ratio, post-compression performance, and inference speed. For example, Birkhoff can achieve a compression ratio of 5.17x on SAM2-B, with less than 1% performance drop without using any fine-tuning data. Moreover, the compression is finished within 60 seconds for all models.",

Recent advancements have primarily focused on refining voxel-level features to construct 3D scenes. However, treating voxels as the basic interaction units inherently limits the utilization of class-level information, which is proven critical for enhancing the granularity of completion results. To address this, we propose \\textbf{D}isentangling Instance and Scene Contexts (DISC), a novel dual-stream paradigm that enhances learning for both instance and scene categories through separated optimization. Specifically, we replace voxel queries with discriminative class queries, which incorporate class-specific geometric and semantic priors. Additionally, we exploit the intrinsic properties of classes to design specialized decoding modules, facilitating targeted interactions and efficient class-level information flow. Experimental results demonstrate that DISC achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on both SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360 benchmarks, with mIoU scores of 17.35 and 20.55, respectively. Remarkably, DISC even outperforms multi-frame SOTA methods using only single-frame input and significantly improves instance category performance, surpassing both single-frame and multi-frame SOTA instance mIoU by 17.9\\% and 11.9\\%, respectively, on the SemanticKITTI hidden test.

However, current publicly available datasets exhibit limitations, such as overly simplistic scenarios, low-resolution footage, and insufficiently diverse conditions, creating a considerable gap between academic research and real-world scenario. To fill this gap, we introduce RoundaboutHD, a comprehensive, high-resolution multi-camera vehicle tracking benchmark dataset specifically designed to represent real-world roundabout scenarios. RoundaboutHD provides a total of 40 minutes of labelled video footage captured by four non-overlapping, high-resolution (4K resolution, 15 fps) cameras. In total, 512 unique vehicle identities are annotated across different camera views, offering rich cross-camera association data. RoundaboutHD offers temporal consistency video footage and enhanced challenges, including increased occlusions and nonlinear movement inside the roundabout. In addition to the full MCVT dataset, several subsets are also available for object detection, single camera tracking, and image-based vehicle re-identification (ReID) tasks. Vehicle model information and camera modelling/ geometry information are also included to support further analysis. We provide baseline results for vehicle detection, single-camera tracking, image-based vehicle re-identification, and multi-camera tracking.

Over-parameterized models such as deep neural networks have an interesting re-descending property in their risk characteristics. This is a recent phenomenon in machine learning and has been the subject of many studies. As the complexity of the model increases, there is a U-shaped region corresponding to the traditional bias-variance trade-off, but then as the number of parameters equals the number of observations and the model becomes one of interpolation, the risk can become infinite and then, in the over-parameterized region, it re-descends -- the double descent effect. We show that this has a natural Bayesian interpretation. Moreover, we show that it is not in conflict with the traditional Occam's razor that Bayesian models possess, in that they tend to prefer simpler models when possible. We illustrate the approach with an example of Bayesian model selection in neural networks. Finally, we conclude with directions for future research.",

However, 7T scanners are costly, scarce, and introduce additional challenges such as susceptibility artifacts. We propose an efficient transformer-based model (7T-Restormer) to synthesize 7T-quality T1-maps from routine 1.5T or 3T T1-weighted (T1W) images. Methods: Our model was validated on 35 1.5T and 108 3T T1w MRI paired with corresponding 7T T1 maps of patients with confirmed MS. A total of 141 patient cases (32,128 slices) were randomly divided into 105 (25; 80) training cases (19,204 slices), 19 (5; 14) validation cases (3,476 slices), and 17 (5; 14) test cases (3,145 slices) where (X; Y) denotes the patients with 1.5T and 3T T1W scans, respectively. The synthetic 7T T1 maps were compared against the ResViT and ResShift models. Results: The 7T-Restormer model achieved a PSNR of 26.0 +/- 4.6 dB, SSIM of 0.861 +/- 0.072, and NMSE of 0.019 +/- 0.011 for 1.5T inputs, and 25.9 +/- 4.9 dB, and 0.866 +/- 0.077 for 3T inputs, respectively. Using 10.5 M parameters, our model reduced NMSE by 64 % relative to 56.7M parameter ResShift (0.019 vs 0.052, p = <.001 and by 41 % relative to 70.4M parameter ResViT (0.019 vs 0.032, p = <.001) at 1.5T, with similar advantages at 3T (0.021 vs 0.060 and 0.033; p < .001). Training with a mixed 1.5 T + 3 T corpus was superior to single-field strategies. Restricting the model to 1.5T increased the 1.5T NMSE from 0.019 to 0.021 (p = 1.1E-3) while training solely on 3T resulted in lower performance on input 1.5T T1W MRI. Conclusion: We propose a novel method for predicting quantitative 7T MP2RAGE maps from 1.5T and 3T T1W scans with higher quality than existing state-of-the-art methods. Our approach makes the benefits of 7T MRI more accessible to standard clinical workflows.",

The current study aimed to examine the temporal relations among expectancies, task values (intrinsic and utility value), and perceived costs (emotional and effort cost) in math to understand the underlying motivational processes for math-related career intention and achievement among middle school girls. To this end, we collected responses from 638 Korean middle school girls three separate times within a year. The autoregressive cross-lagged results revealed that there was no reciprocal relationship between expectancies and task values, but there appeared to be unidirectional positive prediction paths from utility value to self-efficacy. Regarding the costs, there were reciprocal relations between intrinsic value and emotional cost, which negatively affected each other. Consequently, utility value indirectly enhanced girls' math achievement by fostering self-efficacy, whereas emotional cost indirectly hindered their career intentions in math by dampening their intrinsic value. These findings suggest that it is important not only to increase task values, but also to manage costs to help adolescent girls adhere to their math-related career goals.",

However, existing deep learning-based methods face two major challenges: 1) They predominantly adopt a flat classification paradigm, which limits their ability to generate end-to-end multi-granularity hierarchical predictions aligned with tree-structured hierarchies used in practice. 2) Most cross-domain studies focus on performance degradation caused by sensor or scene variations, with limited attention to transferring LCLU models to cross-domain tasks with heterogeneous hierarchies (e.g., LCLU to crop classification). These limitations hinder the flexibility and generalization of LCLU models in practical applications. To address these challenges, we propose HieraRS, a novel hierarchical interpretation paradigm that enables multi-granularity predictions and supports the efficient transfer of LCLU models to cross-domain tasks with heterogeneous tree-structured hierarchies. We introduce the Bidirectional Hierarchical Consistency Constraint Mechanism (BHCCM), which can be seamlessly integrated into mainstream flat classification models to generate hierarchical predictions, while improving both semantic consistency and classification accuracy. Furthermore, we present TransLU, a dual-branch cross-domain transfer framework comprising two key components: Cross-Domain Knowledge Sharing (CDKS) and Cross-Domain Semantic Alignment (CDSA). TransLU supports dynamic category expansion and facilitates the effective adaptation of LCLU models to heterogeneous hierarchies. In addition, we construct MM-5B, a large-scale multi-modal hierarchical land use dataset featuring pixel-wise annotations. The code and MM-5B dataset will be released at: https://github.com/AI-Tianlong/HieraRS.",

Large models offer a solution via data generation. Nonetheless, real-world data are obviously more valuable comparing to artificially intelligence generated data, particularly in constructing image datasets. For this reason, we propose a novel method for auto-constructing datasets from real-world images by a multiagent collaborative system, named as DatasetAgent. By coordinating four different agents equipped with Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), as well as a tool package for image optimization, DatasetAgent is able to construct high-quality image datasets according to user-specified requirements. In particular, two types of experiments are conducted, including expanding existing datasets and creating new ones from scratch, on a variety of open-source datasets. In both cases, multiple image datasets constructed by DatasetAgent are used to train various vision models for image classification, object detection, and image segmentation.",

Several studies have shown that the performance of these 3D perception methods can be further enhanced by combining sequential BEV features obtained from multiple camera frames. However, even after compensating for the ego-motion of an autonomous agent, the performance gain from temporal aggregation is limited when combining a large number of image frames. This limitation arises due to dynamic changes in BEV features over time caused by object motion. In this paper, we introduce a novel temporal 3D perception method called OnlineBEV, which combines BEV features over time using a recurrent structure. This structure increases the effective number of combined features with minimal memory usage. However, it is critical to spatially align the features over time to maintain strong performance. OnlineBEV employs the Motion-guided BEV Fusion Network (MBFNet) to achieve temporal feature alignment. MBFNet extracts motion features from consecutive BEV frames and dynamically aligns historical BEV features with current ones using these motion features. To enforce temporal feature alignment explicitly, we use Temporal Consistency Learning Loss, which captures discrepancies between historical and target BEV features. Experiments conducted on the nuScenes benchmark demonstrate that OnlineBEV achieves significant performance gains over the current best method, SOLOFusion. OnlineBEV achieves 63.9% NDS on the nuScenes test set, recording state-of-the-art performance in the camera-only 3D object detection task.",

Little research, however, has investigated how generating analogies can support college students’ self-regulated learning (SRL) of biology. This study therefore evaluated a contextualized cognitive learning strategy intervention designed to teach students to generate analogies as a learning strategy to aid learning within a university biology course. Participants (n = 179) were taught how to generate analogies as a learning strategy to learn about plant and animal physiology. We hypothesized the quality of students’ generated analogies would increase over time, and their analogical reasoning, knowledge of cognition (KOC; a component of metacognitive awareness), and course performance would be higher after intervention, controlling for associated pre-intervention values. Regression analyses and repeated-measures analysis of variance indicated a positive relationship between generated-analogy quality and analogical reasoning, and increased analogy quality after intervention. No change in reported KOC was observed, and analogy quality did not predict course performance. Findings extend understanding of strategies that can support college students’ biology learning. Researchers and practitioners can leverage our approach to teaching analogies in their own research and classrooms to support students’ SRL, analogical reasoning, and learning.",

While ample research has highlighted the positive associations of expectancy beliefs and task values with academic achievement, research on students' perceived costs is in its infancy. We investigated the temporal interrelations among expectancies, task values and different types of perceived cost, the role of these constructs in biology achievement, and the role of perceived costs as a moderator in the relations of expectancy beliefs to biology achievement. A cross-lagged path analysis of semester-long data from 234 undergraduate biology students pointed to variable relations among expectancies, task values, perceived costs, and biology achievement. For example, while early expectancy beliefs related to later attainment and interest value, early task values and perceived costs did not relate to later expectancy beliefs. Furthermore, early attainment value related to later effort and opportunity cost. Expectancy beliefs and effort and opportunity cost in biology were associated with final biology grade. Finally, effort cost moderated the relations between expectancy beliefs and students' final grades. These findings provide evidence for the dynamic relations among perceived costs, task values, and expectancy beliefs over a semester and point to the interplay between expectancies and perceived costs in their relation to academic achievement in science.",

          "input_text": "Student anxiety in introductory biology classrooms: Perceptions about active learning and persistence in the major Many researchers have called for implementation of active learning practices in undergraduate science classrooms as one method to increase retention and persistence in STEM, yet there has been little research on the potential increases in student anxiety that may accompany these practices. This is of concern because excessive anxiety can decrease student performance. Levels and sources of student anxiety in three introductory biology lecture classes were investigated via an online survey and student interviews. The survey (n = 327) data revealed that 16% of students had moderately high classroom anxiety, which differed among the three classes. All five active learning classroom practices that were investigated caused student anxiety, with students voluntarily answering a question or being called on to answer a question causing higher anxiety than working in groups, completing worksheets, or answering clicker questions. Interviews revealed that student anxiety seemed to align with communication apprehension, social anxiety, and test anxiety. Additionally, students with higher general anxiety were more likely to self-report lower course grade and the intention to leave the major. These data suggest that a subset of students in introductory biology experience anxiety in response to active learning, and its potential impacts should be investigated.",

          "input_text": "Ensemble of Weak Spectral Total Variation Learners: a PET-CT Case Study Solving computer vision problems through machine learning, one often encounters lack of sufficient training data. To mitigate this we propose the use of ensembles of weak learners based on spectral total-variation (STV) features (Gilboa 2014). The features are related to nonlinear eigenfunctions of the total-variation subgradient and can characterize well textures at various scales. It was shown (Burger et-al 2016) that, in the one-dimensional case, orthogonal features are generated, whereas in two-dimensions the features are empirically lowly correlated. Ensemble learning theory advocates the use of lowly correlated weak learners. We thus propose here to design ensembles using learners based on STV features. To show the effectiveness of this paradigm we examine a hard real-world medical imaging problem: the predictive value of computed tomography (CT) data for high uptake in positron emission tomography (PET) for patients suspected of skeletal metastases. The database consists of 457 scans with 1524 unique pairs of registered CT and PET slices. Our approach is compared to deep-learning methods and to Radiomics features, showing STV learners perform best (AUC=0.87), compared to neural nets (AUC=0.75) and Radiomics (AUC=0.79). We observe that fine STV scales in CT images are especially indicative for the presence of high uptake in PET.",

Sample & methods Undergraduate students (N = 152) learned from a video-recorded lecture, and then engaged in follow-up learning activities involving retrieval practice, restudy, elaboration, or a combination of retrieval practice with elaboration. We ensured that initial retrieval success was high and that all groups had the same expectations about the nature of content to be tested. We assessed both factual knowledge and comprehension, as well as the respective indicators of metacognitive-monitoring accuracy (metamemory, metacomprehension). We assessed self-efficacy and situational interest as motivational variables. Results In a one-week-delayed posttest, elaboration improved factual knowledge and comprehension. This pattern held whether learners just elaborated or additionally engaged in retrieval practice. Having students self-generate their own examples during retrieval practice improved comprehension, but merely letting students retrieve experimenter-provided examples did not. Students' self-reported mental effort mediated the factual knowledge benefits of retrieval practice. The number of students’ self-generated elaborations mediated comprehension benefits. Students engaging in constructive retrieval while learning revealed the highest metacognitive-monitoring accuracy in factual knowledge and comprehension. We found no differences between conditions regarding situational interest and self-efficacy. Motivation to reuse the respective learning strategies was higher in all conditions compared to restudy. Conclusion Constructive retrieval seems advantageous when considering its benefits on learning outcomes and metacognition. When working on retrieval tasks, students only profited from self-generated, but not from provided, examples with respect to comprehension.",

Recent advancements have primarily focused on refining voxel-level features to construct 3D scenes. However, treating voxels as the basic interaction units inherently limits the utilization of class-level information, which is proven critical for enhancing the granularity of completion results. To address this, we propose \\textbf{D}isentangling Instance and Scene Contexts (DISC), a novel dual-stream paradigm that enhances learning for both instance and scene categories through separated optimization. Specifically, we replace voxel queries with discriminative class queries, which incorporate class-specific geometric and semantic priors. Additionally, we exploit the intrinsic properties of classes to design specialized decoding modules, facilitating targeted interactions and efficient class-level information flow. Experimental results demonstrate that DISC achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on both SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360 benchmarks, with mIoU scores of 17.35 and 20.55, respectively. Remarkably, DISC even outperforms multi-frame SOTA methods using only single-frame input and significantly improves instance category performance, surpassing both single-frame and multi-frame SOTA instance mIoU by 17.9\\% and 11.9\\%, respectively, on the SemanticKITTI hidden test.

However, automated segmentation remains limited by high computational costs, reliance on large training datasets, and reduced accuracy in segmenting smaller muscles. Convolutional neural network (CNN)-based methods, while powerful, often suffer from substantial computational overhead, limited generalizability, and poor interpretability across diverse populations. This study proposes a training-free segmentation approach based on keypoint tracking, which integrates keypoint selection with Lucas-Kanade optical flow. The proposed method achieves a mean Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) ranging from 0.6 to 0.7, depending on the keypoint selection strategy, performing comparably to state-of-the-art CNN-based models while substantially reducing computational demands and enhancing interpretability. This scalable framework presents a robust and explainable alternative for muscle segmentation in clinical and research applications.",

Therefore, effectively compressing SAMs has become an increasingly pressing practical need. In this study, we propose Birkhoff, a novel data-free compression algorithm for SAM and its variants. Unlike quantization, pruning, distillation, and other compression methods, Birkhoff embodies versatility across model types, agility in deployment, faithfulness to the original model, and compactness in model size. Specifically, Birkhoff introduces a novel compression algorithm: Hyper-Compression, whose core principle is to find a dense trajectory to turn a high-dimensional parameter vector into a low-dimensional scalar. Furthermore, Birkhoff designs a dedicated linear layer operator, HyperLinear, to fuse decompression and matrix multiplication to significantly accelerate inference of the compressed SAMs. Extensive experiments on 18 SAMs in the COCO, LVIS, and SA-1B datasets show that Birkhoff performs consistently and competitively in compression time, compression ratio, post-compression performance, and inference speed. For example, Birkhoff can achieve a compression ratio of 5.17x on SAM2-B, with less than 1% performance drop without using any fine-tuning data. Moreover, the compression is finished within 60 seconds for all models.",

However, automated segmentation remains limited by high computational costs, reliance on large training datasets, and reduced accuracy in segmenting smaller muscles. Convolutional neural network (CNN)-based methods, while powerful, often suffer from substantial computational overhead, limited generalizability, and poor interpretability across diverse populations. This study proposes a training-free segmentation approach based on keypoint tracking, which integrates keypoint selection with Lucas-Kanade optical flow. The proposed method achieves a mean Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) ranging from 0.6 to 0.7, depending on the keypoint selection strategy, performing comparably to state-of-the-art CNN-based models while substantially reducing computational demands and enhancing interpretability. This scalable framework presents a robust and explainable alternative for muscle segmentation in clinical and research applications.",

This enables efficient and synchronized simulation of multimodal data, including CSI, RGB, Radar, and LiDAR.

A systematic review and meta-analyses The regulation of motivation is considered a key aspect of self-regulated learning (SRL) as it is presumed that maintaining an adequate level of motivation is essential for engagement, effort and persistence in academic tasks. In this review, we aimed to improve our understanding of motivational regulation strategies, their supposed antecedents and the educational implications. A search was conducted in Web of Science, Scopus, PsycInfo, and ERIC databases. Of 4027 records identified, 64 (75 studies) were deemed eligible after inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied and studies with low methodological quality were discarded. Data on 18 different motivational regulation strategies were available. Extrinsic/controlling types of strategies were reported to be used more frequently than intrinsic/autonomous strategies. Motivational regulation strategies were significantly associated with metamotivational beliefs, academic skills and adjustment. Available evidence supports assumptions of theoretical models on antecedents and academic implications of motivational self-regulation. Educational impact and implications statement The present study provides a compendium of the different motivational self-regulation strategies studied to date, describes the nature of these and unifies the different denominations used. The available evidence on the frequency of use of the different strategies that has been collected may be useful for educators, enabling them to anticipate and adapt to the status of the different motivational facets in students. Drawing on theoretical models of motivational self-regulation, the interconnections between the use of the strategies and their supposed antecedents and the expected educational implications were explored. This will provide researchers and educators with an interpretive framework to draw upon when adapting to interindividual diversity in strategy use and when assessing the compatibility between educational practices and the efficient use and training of motivational strategies.",

Large models offer a solution via data generation. Nonetheless, real-world data are obviously more valuable comparing to artificially intelligence generated data, particularly in constructing image datasets. For this reason, we propose a novel method for auto-constructing datasets from real-world images by a multiagent collaborative system, named as DatasetAgent. By coordinating four different agents equipped with Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), as well as a tool package for image optimization, DatasetAgent is able to construct high-quality image datasets according to user-specified requirements. In particular, two types of experiments are conducted, including expanding existing datasets and creating new ones from scratch, on a variety of open-source datasets. In both cases, multiple image datasets constructed by DatasetAgent are used to train various vision models for image classification, object detection, and image segmentation.",

          "input_text": "Hess-MC2: Sequential Monte Carlo Squared using Hessian Information and Second Order Proposals When performing Bayesian inference using Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods, two considerations arise: the accuracy of the posterior approximation and computational efficiency. To address computational demands, Sequential Monte Carlo Squared (SMC$^2$) is well-suited for high-performance computing (HPC) environments. The design of the proposal distribution within SMC$^2$ can improve accuracy and exploration of the posterior as poor proposals may lead to high variance in importance weights and particle degeneracy. The Metropolis-Adjusted Langevin Algorithm (MALA) uses gradient information so that particles preferentially explore regions of higher probability. In this paper, we extend this idea by incorporating second-order information, specifically the Hessian of the log-target. While second-order proposals have been explored previously in particle Markov Chain Monte Carlo (p-MCMC) methods, we are the first to introduce them within the SMC$^2$ framework. Second-order proposals not only use the gradient (first-order derivative), but also the curvature (second-order derivative) of the target distribution. Experimental results on synthetic models highlight the benefits of our approach in terms of step-size selection and posterior approximation accuracy when compared to other proposals.",

In 1966, Taylor constructed a free resolution for monomial ideals in polynomial rings, which Gemeda later showed admits a differential graded (DG) algebra structure. In 2002, Avramov proved that the Taylor resolution admits a DG algebra structure with divided powers. In 2007, Herzog introduced the generalized Taylor resolution, which is usually smaller than the original Taylor resolution. Recently, in 2023, VandeBogert showed that the generalized Taylor resolution also admits a DG algebra structure. In this paper, we extend Avramov's result by proving that the generalized Taylor resolution admits a DG algebra structure with divided powers. Along the way, we correct a sign error in VandeBogert's product formula. We provide applications concerning homotopy Lie algebras and resolutions of squarefree monomial ideals.",

Empirical Insights into Undergraduate Life Science Majors' Emotions about Mathematics Undergraduate life science majors are reputed to have negative emotions toward mathematics, yet little empirical evidence supports this. We sought to compare emotions of majors in the life sciences versus other natural sciences and math. We adapted the Attitudes toward the Subject of Chemistry Inventory to create an Attitudes toward the Subject of Mathematics Inventory (ASMI). We collected data from 359 science and math majors at two research universities and conducted a series of statistical tests that indicated that four AMSI items comprised a reasonable measure of students' emotional satisfaction with math. We then compared life science and non-life science majors and found that major had a small to moderate relationship with students' responses. Gender also had a small relationship with students' responses, while students' race, ethnicity, and year in school had no observable relationship. Using latent profile analysis, we identified three groups-students who were emotionally satisfied with math, emotionally dissatisfied with math, and neutral. These results and the emotional satisfaction with math scale should be useful for identifying differences in other undergraduate populations, determining the malleability of undergraduates' emotional satisfaction with math, and testing effects of interventions aimed at improving life science majors' attitudes toward math.",

This study investigated how gender and SES related to achievement mediated by expectancy of success, STV, and their interaction. The sample consisted of 396 participants in their final year of upper secondary education. Self-report measures were completed of expectancy, STV, gender and socio-economic indicators. These were linked to exit examination grades (A Levels). Only parental education was directly related to achievement however gender and SES were indirectly linked to student grades through expectancy, STV, and the expectancy-STV interaction. Males, students with a higher level of parental education, and students from households with a higher number of possessions, all performed better in their examination due to higher expectations; higher STV amplified these relations. Gender and SES differences in achievement can be partly explained by psychological factors, namely students’ expectations of success and STV.",

Its ability to capture intrinsic similarities and differences among data samples has led to state-of-the-art results in computer vision tasks. These strengths make CL particularly well-suited for Earth System Observation (ESO), where diverse satellite modalities such as optical and SAR imagery offer naturally aligned views of the same geospatial regions. However, ESO presents unique challenges, including high inter-class similarity, scene clutter, and ambiguous boundaries, which complicate representation learning -- especially in low-label, multi-label settings. Existing CL frameworks often focus on intra-modality self-supervision or lack mechanisms for multi-label alignment and semantic precision across modalities. In this work, we introduce MoSAiC, a unified framework that jointly optimizes intra- and inter-modality contrastive learning with a multi-label supervised contrastive loss. Designed specifically for multi-modal satellite imagery, MoSAiC enables finer semantic disentanglement and more robust representation learning across spectrally similar and spatially complex classes. Experiments on two benchmark datasets, BigEarthNet V2.0 and Sent12MS, show that MoSAiC consistently outperforms both fully supervised and self-supervised baselines in terms of accuracy, cluster coherence, and generalization in low-label and high-class-overlap scenarios.",

The current study aimed to examine the temporal relations among expectancies, task values (intrinsic and utility value), and perceived costs (emotional and effort cost) in math to understand the underlying motivational processes for math-related career intention and achievement among middle school girls. To this end, we collected responses from 638 Korean middle school girls three separate times within a year. The autoregressive cross-lagged results revealed that there was no reciprocal relationship between expectancies and task values, but there appeared to be unidirectional positive prediction paths from utility value to self-efficacy. Regarding the costs, there were reciprocal relations between intrinsic value and emotional cost, which negatively affected each other. Consequently, utility value indirectly enhanced girls' math achievement by fostering self-efficacy, whereas emotional cost indirectly hindered their career intentions in math by dampening their intrinsic value. These findings suggest that it is important not only to increase task values, but also to manage costs to help adolescent girls adhere to their math-related career goals.",

CLiFT enables compute-efficient rendering by compressed tokens, while being capable of changing the number of tokens to represent a scene or render a novel view with one trained network. Concretely, given a set of images, multi-view encoder tokenizes the images with the camera poses. Latent-space K-means selects a reduced set of rays as cluster centroids using the tokens. The multi-view ``condenser'' compresses the information of all the tokens into the centroid tokens to construct CLiFTs. At test time, given a target view and a compute budget (i.e., the number of CLiFTs), the system collects the specified number of nearby tokens and synthesizes a novel view using a compute-adaptive renderer. Extensive experiments on RealEstate10K and DL3DV datasets quantitatively and qualitatively validate our approach, achieving significant data reduction with comparable rendering quality and the highest overall rendering score, while providing trade-offs of data size, rendering quality, and rendering speed.",

We examined whether two psychological variables, social anxiety (psychological distress relating to the fear of negative evaluation by others) and academic self-efficacy (confidence in one's ability to overcome academic challenges), interact with student perceptions of evidence-based instructional practices (EBIPs) and associate with their final grades in a STEM-related course. Human anatomy and physiology students in community college courses rated various EBIPs for their perceived educational value and their capacity to elicit anxiety (N = 227). In general, practices causing students the most anxiety (e.g., cold calling) were reported by students as having the least educational value. When controlling for students' self-reported grade point averages, socially anxious students rated several EBIPs as more anxiety inducing, whereas high-efficacy students reported less anxiety surrounding other EBIPs. Furthermore, mediation analysis revealed that individual differences in academic self-efficacy at the beginning of the term explained some of the negative association between students' social anxiety levels and final grades in the course. Our results, obtained in a community college context, support a growing body of evidence that social anxiety and academic self-efficacy are linked with how students perceive and perform in an active-learning environment.",

L-CLIPScore is calculated from a lightweight CLIP (L-CLIP), which is a dual-encoder architecture compressed and distilled from CLIP. To compress, we apply two powerful techniques which are weight multiplexing and matrix decomposition for reducing the parameters of encoders and word embedding matrix, respectively. To distill, we design a novel multi-modal Similarity Regulator (SR) loss to transfer more vision-language alignment knowledge. Specifically, SR loss amplifies the multi-modal embedding similarity if the given image-text pair is matched and diminishes the similarity if the pair is non-matched. By compressing and distilling by this novel SR loss, our L-CLIP achieves comparable multi-modal alignment ability to the original CLIP while it requires fewer computation resources and running time. We carry out exhaustive experiments to validate the efficiency and effectiveness of L-CLIPScore when using it as the judge to evaluate caption quality. We also discover that when using L-CLIPScore as the supervisor to train the captioning model, it should be mixed up by an n-gram-based metric and meanwhile analyze why using L-CLIPScore only will cause fail training.",

Curricular reform efforts in QR have been directed at disseminating course design and pedagogy but less work has been directed at understanding what faculty at large view as crucial for student success in their courses. We conducted semi-structured interviews of 15 faculty teaching in an introductory biology course sequence to determine (1) what participants viewed as QR competencies crucial for student success, and (2) their perceptions of student preparedness for QR in context. Participant responses fell into four categories (Quantitative Reasoning, Process of Science, Modeling, and Affective Factors) which largely align with competencies called for in recent publications. Additionally, participants noted that many students lacked these QR competencies upon matriculation. Characterization of QR skills crucial for success can help guide curricular reform not only in biology, but also in the context of other STEM disciplines.",

NeuralOS combines a recurrent neural network (RNN), which tracks computer state, with a diffusion-based neural renderer that generates screen images. The model is trained on a large-scale dataset of Ubuntu XFCE recordings, which include both randomly generated interactions and realistic interactions produced by AI agents. Experiments show that NeuralOS successfully renders realistic GUI sequences, accurately captures mouse interactions, and reliably predicts state transitions like application launches. Although modeling fine-grained keyboard interactions precisely remains challenging, NeuralOS offers a step toward creating fully adaptive, generative neural interfaces for future human-computer interaction systems.",

Several studies have shown that the performance of these 3D perception methods can be further enhanced by combining sequential BEV features obtained from multiple camera frames. However, even after compensating for the ego-motion of an autonomous agent, the performance gain from temporal aggregation is limited when combining a large number of image frames. This limitation arises due to dynamic changes in BEV features over time caused by object motion. In this paper, we introduce a novel temporal 3D perception method called OnlineBEV, which combines BEV features over time using a recurrent structure. This structure increases the effective number of combined features with minimal memory usage. However, it is critical to spatially align the features over time to maintain strong performance. OnlineBEV employs the Motion-guided BEV Fusion Network (MBFNet) to achieve temporal feature alignment. MBFNet extracts motion features from consecutive BEV frames and dynamically aligns historical BEV features with current ones using these motion features. To enforce temporal feature alignment explicitly, we use Temporal Consistency Learning Loss, which captures discrepancies between historical and target BEV features. Experiments conducted on the nuScenes benchmark demonstrate that OnlineBEV achieves significant performance gains over the current best method, SOLOFusion. OnlineBEV achieves 63.9% NDS on the nuScenes test set, recording state-of-the-art performance in the camera-only 3D object detection task.",

While hurricane preparedness and response strategies vastly rely on the accuracy and timeliness of the predicted households' evacuation decisions, current studies featuring psychological-driven linear models leave some significant limitations in practice. Hence, the present study proposes a new methodology for predicting households' evacuation decisions constructed by easily accessible demographic and resource-related predictors compared to current models with a high reliance on psychological factors. Meanwhile, an enhanced logistic regression (ELR) model that could automatically account for nonlinearities (i.e., univariate and bivariate threshold effects) by an interpretable machine learning approach is developed to secure the accuracy of the results. Specifically, low-depth decision trees are selected for nonlinearity detection to identify the critical thresholds, build a transparent model structure, and solidify the robustness. Then, an empirical dataset collected after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita is hired to examine the practicability of the new methodology. The results indicate that the enhanced logistic regression (ELR) model has the most convincing performance in explaining the variation of the households' evacuation decision in model fit and prediction capability compared to previous linear models. It suggests that the proposed methodology could provide a new tool and framework for the emergency management authorities to improve the estimation of evacuation traffic demands in a timely and accurate manner.",

Over-parameterized models such as deep neural networks have an interesting re-descending property in their risk characteristics. This is a recent phenomenon in machine learning and has been the subject of many studies. As the complexity of the model increases, there is a U-shaped region corresponding to the traditional bias-variance trade-off, but then as the number of parameters equals the number of observations and the model becomes one of interpolation, the risk can become infinite and then, in the over-parameterized region, it re-descends -- the double descent effect. We show that this has a natural Bayesian interpretation. Moreover, we show that it is not in conflict with the traditional Occam's razor that Bayesian models possess, in that they tend to prefer simpler models when possible. We illustrate the approach with an example of Bayesian model selection in neural networks. Finally, we conclude with directions for future research.",

Self-advocacy is defined as communicating individual wants, needs, and rights to determine and pursue required accommodations. While self-advocacy is linked to academic success, little is known about how students with disabilities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) practice self-advocacy. We previously developed a model of self-advocacy for STEM students with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and/or specific learning disabilities (SLD). Here, we use this model to examine what factors support or hinder self-advocacy in undergraduate STEM courses. We conducted semistructured interviews with 25 STEM majors with ADHD and/or SLD and used qualitative approaches to analyze our data. We found internal factors, or factors within a participant, and external factors, the situations and people, described by our participants, that influenced self-advocacy. These factors often interacted and functioned as a support or barrier, depending on the individuals and their unique experiences. We developed a model to understand how factors supported or hindered self-advocacy in STEM. Supporting factors contributed to a sense of comfort and security for our participants and informed their perceptions that accommodation use was accepted in a STEM course. We share implications for research and teaching based on our results.",

This is usually the case in digital pathology, which consists of gigapixel sized images. While deterministic attention-based MIL approaches achieve strong bag-level performance, they often overlook the uncertainty inherent in instance relevance. In this paper, we address the lack of uncertainty quantification in instance-level attention scores by introducing \\textbf{SGPMIL}, a new probabilistic attention-based MIL framework grounded in Sparse Gaussian Processes (SGP). By learning a posterior distribution over attention scores, SGPMIL enables principled uncertainty estimation, resulting in more reliable and calibrated instance relevance maps. Our approach not only preserves competitive bag-level performance but also significantly improves the quality and interpretability of instance-level predictions under uncertainty. SGPMIL extends prior work by introducing feature scaling in the SGP predictive mean function, leading to faster training, improved efficiency, and enhanced instance-level performance. Extensive experiments on multiple well-established digital pathology datasets highlight the effectiveness of our approach across both bag- and instance-level evaluations. Our code will be made publicly available.",

A systematic review and meta-analyses The regulation of motivation is considered a key aspect of self-regulated learning (SRL) as it is presumed that maintaining an adequate level of motivation is essential for engagement, effort and persistence in academic tasks. In this review, we aimed to improve our understanding of motivational regulation strategies, their supposed antecedents and the educational implications. A search was conducted in Web of Science, Scopus, PsycInfo, and ERIC databases. Of 4027 records identified, 64 (75 studies) were deemed eligible after inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied and studies with low methodological quality were discarded. Data on 18 different motivational regulation strategies were available. Extrinsic/controlling types of strategies were reported to be used more frequently than intrinsic/autonomous strategies. Motivational regulation strategies were significantly associated with metamotivational beliefs, academic skills and adjustment. Available evidence supports assumptions of theoretical models on antecedents and academic implications of motivational self-regulation. Educational impact and implications statement The present study provides a compendium of the different motivational self-regulation strategies studied to date, describes the nature of these and unifies the different denominations used. The available evidence on the frequency of use of the different strategies that has been collected may be useful for educators, enabling them to anticipate and adapt to the status of the different motivational facets in students. Drawing on theoretical models of motivational self-regulation, the interconnections between the use of the strategies and their supposed antecedents and the expected educational implications were explored. This will provide researchers and educators with an interpretive framework to draw upon when adapting to interindividual diversity in strategy use and when assessing the compatibility between educational practices and the efficient use and training of motivational strategies.",

Currently employed architectures have mostly been developed manually by human experts, which is a time-consuming and error-prone process. Because of this, there is growing interest in automated neural architecture search methods. We provide an overview of existing work in this field of research and categorize them according to three dimensions: search space, search strategy, and performance estimation strategy.",

          "input_text": "Ensemble of Weak Spectral Total Variation Learners: a PET-CT Case Study Solving computer vision problems through machine learning, one often encounters lack of sufficient training data. To mitigate this we propose the use of ensembles of weak learners based on spectral total-variation (STV) features (Gilboa 2014). The features are related to nonlinear eigenfunctions of the total-variation subgradient and can characterize well textures at various scales. It was shown (Burger et-al 2016) that, in the one-dimensional case, orthogonal features are generated, whereas in two-dimensions the features are empirically lowly correlated. Ensemble learning theory advocates the use of lowly correlated weak learners. We thus propose here to design ensembles using learners based on STV features. To show the effectiveness of this paradigm we examine a hard real-world medical imaging problem: the predictive value of computed tomography (CT) data for high uptake in positron emission tomography (PET) for patients suspected of skeletal metastases. The database consists of 457 scans with 1524 unique pairs of registered CT and PET slices. Our approach is compared to deep-learning methods and to Radiomics features, showing STV learners perform best (AUC=0.87), compared to neural nets (AUC=0.75) and Radiomics (AUC=0.79). We observe that fine STV scales in CT images are especially indicative for the presence of high uptake in PET.",

In 1966, Taylor constructed a free resolution for monomial ideals in polynomial rings, which Gemeda later showed admits a differential graded (DG) algebra structure. In 2002, Avramov proved that the Taylor resolution admits a DG algebra structure with divided powers. In 2007, Herzog introduced the generalized Taylor resolution, which is usually smaller than the original Taylor resolution. Recently, in 2023, VandeBogert showed that the generalized Taylor resolution also admits a DG algebra structure. In this paper, we extend Avramov's result by proving that the generalized Taylor resolution admits a DG algebra structure with divided powers. Along the way, we correct a sign error in VandeBogert's product formula. We provide applications concerning homotopy Lie algebras and resolutions of squarefree monomial ideals.",

Psychology students were randomly assigned to meet in person with the course instructor and complete a learning reflection form prior to a test. Students who completed these tasks prior to the second test in the course outperformed other students.

Large models offer a solution via data generation. Nonetheless, real-world data are obviously more valuable comparing to artificially intelligence generated data, particularly in constructing image datasets. For this reason, we propose a novel method for auto-constructing datasets from real-world images by a multiagent collaborative system, named as DatasetAgent. By coordinating four different agents equipped with Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), as well as a tool package for image optimization, DatasetAgent is able to construct high-quality image datasets according to user-specified requirements. In particular, two types of experiments are conducted, including expanding existing datasets and creating new ones from scratch, on a variety of open-source datasets. In both cases, multiple image datasets constructed by DatasetAgent are used to train various vision models for image classification, object detection, and image segmentation.",

Therefore, effectively compressing SAMs has become an increasingly pressing practical need. In this study, we propose Birkhoff, a novel data-free compression algorithm for SAM and its variants. Unlike quantization, pruning, distillation, and other compression methods, Birkhoff embodies versatility across model types, agility in deployment, faithfulness to the original model, and compactness in model size. Specifically, Birkhoff introduces a novel compression algorithm: Hyper-Compression, whose core principle is to find a dense trajectory to turn a high-dimensional parameter vector into a low-dimensional scalar. Furthermore, Birkhoff designs a dedicated linear layer operator, HyperLinear, to fuse decompression and matrix multiplication to significantly accelerate inference of the compressed SAMs. Extensive experiments on 18 SAMs in the COCO, LVIS, and SA-1B datasets show that Birkhoff performs consistently and competitively in compression time, compression ratio, post-compression performance, and inference speed. For example, Birkhoff can achieve a compression ratio of 5.17x on SAM2-B, with less than 1% performance drop without using any fine-tuning data. Moreover, the compression is finished within 60 seconds for all models.",

Recent advancements have primarily focused on refining voxel-level features to construct 3D scenes. However, treating voxels as the basic interaction units inherently limits the utilization of class-level information, which is proven critical for enhancing the granularity of completion results. To address this, we propose \\textbf{D}isentangling Instance and Scene Contexts (DISC), a novel dual-stream paradigm that enhances learning for both instance and scene categories through separated optimization. Specifically, we replace voxel queries with discriminative class queries, which incorporate class-specific geometric and semantic priors. Additionally, we exploit the intrinsic properties of classes to design specialized decoding modules, facilitating targeted interactions and efficient class-level information flow. Experimental results demonstrate that DISC achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on both SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360 benchmarks, with mIoU scores of 17.35 and 20.55, respectively. Remarkably, DISC even outperforms multi-frame SOTA methods using only single-frame input and significantly improves instance category performance, surpassing both single-frame and multi-frame SOTA instance mIoU by 17.9\\% and 11.9\\%, respectively, on the SemanticKITTI hidden test.

However, current publicly available datasets exhibit limitations, such as overly simplistic scenarios, low-resolution footage, and insufficiently diverse conditions, creating a considerable gap between academic research and real-world scenario. To fill this gap, we introduce RoundaboutHD, a comprehensive, high-resolution multi-camera vehicle tracking benchmark dataset specifically designed to represent real-world roundabout scenarios. RoundaboutHD provides a total of 40 minutes of labelled video footage captured by four non-overlapping, high-resolution (4K resolution, 15 fps) cameras. In total, 512 unique vehicle identities are annotated across different camera views, offering rich cross-camera association data. RoundaboutHD offers temporal consistency video footage and enhanced challenges, including increased occlusions and nonlinear movement inside the roundabout. In addition to the full MCVT dataset, several subsets are also available for object detection, single camera tracking, and image-based vehicle re-identification (ReID) tasks. Vehicle model information and camera modelling/ geometry information are also included to support further analysis. We provide baseline results for vehicle detection, single-camera tracking, image-based vehicle re-identification, and multi-camera tracking. The dataset and the evaluation code are publicly available at: https://github.com/siri-rouser/RoundaboutHD.git",

Over-parameterized models such as deep neural networks have an interesting re-descending property in their risk characteristics. This is a recent phenomenon in machine learning and has been the subject of many studies. As the complexity of the model increases, there is a U-shaped region corresponding to the traditional bias-variance trade-off, but then as the number of parameters equals the number of observations and the model becomes one of interpolation, the risk can become infinite and then, in the over-parameterized region, it re-descends -- the double descent effect. We show that this has a natural Bayesian interpretation. Moreover, we show that it is not in conflict with the traditional Occam's razor that Bayesian models possess, in that they tend to prefer simpler models when possible. We illustrate the approach with an example of Bayesian model selection in neural networks. Finally, we conclude with directions for future research.",

However, 7T scanners are costly, scarce, and introduce additional challenges such as susceptibility artifacts. We propose an efficient transformer-based model (7T-Restormer) to synthesize 7T-quality T1-maps from routine 1.5T or 3T T1-weighted (T1W) images. Methods: Our model was validated on 35 1.5T and 108 3T T1w MRI paired with corresponding 7T T1 maps of patients with confirmed MS. A total of 141 patient cases (32,128 slices) were randomly divided into 105 (25; 80) training cases (19,204 slices), 19 (5; 14) validation cases (3,476 slices), and 17 (5; 14) test cases (3,145 slices) where (X; Y) denotes the patients with 1.5T and 3T T1W scans, respectively. The synthetic 7T T1 maps were compared against the ResViT and ResShift models. Results: The 7T-Restormer model achieved a PSNR of 26.0 +/- 4.6 dB, SSIM of 0.861 +/- 0.072, and NMSE of 0.019 +/- 0.011 for 1.5T inputs, and 25.9 +/- 4.9 dB, and 0.866 +/- 0.077 for 3T inputs, respectively. Using 10.5 M parameters, our model reduced NMSE by 64 % relative to 56.7M parameter ResShift (0.019 vs 0.052, p = <.001 and by 41 % relative to 70.4M parameter ResViT (0.019 vs 0.032, p = <.001) at 1.5T, with similar advantages at 3T (0.021 vs 0.060 and 0.033; p < .001). Training with a mixed 1.5 T + 3 T corpus was superior to single-field strategies. Restricting the model to 1.5T increased the 1.5T NMSE from 0.019 to 0.021 (p = 1.1E-3) while training solely on 3T resulted in lower performance on input 1.5T T1W MRI. Conclusion: We propose a novel method for predicting quantitative 7T MP2RAGE maps from 1.5T and 3T T1W scans with higher quality than existing state-of-the-art methods. Our approach makes the benefits of 7T MRI more accessible to standard clinical workflows.",

The current study aimed to examine the temporal relations among expectancies, task values (intrinsic and utility value), and perceived costs (emotional and effort cost) in math to understand the underlying motivational processes for math-related career intention and achievement among middle school girls. To this end, we collected responses from 638 Korean middle school girls three separate times within a year. The autoregressive cross-lagged results revealed that there was no reciprocal relationship between expectancies and task values, but there appeared to be unidirectional positive prediction paths from utility value to self-efficacy. Regarding the costs, there were reciprocal relations between intrinsic value and emotional cost, which negatively affected each other. Consequently, utility value indirectly enhanced girls' math achievement by fostering self-efficacy, whereas emotional cost indirectly hindered their career intentions in math by dampening their intrinsic value. These findings suggest that it is important not only to increase task values, but also to manage costs to help adolescent girls adhere to their math-related career goals.",

However, existing deep learning-based methods face two major challenges: 1) They predominantly adopt a flat classification paradigm, which limits their ability to generate end-to-end multi-granularity hierarchical predictions aligned with tree-structured hierarchies used in practice. 2) Most cross-domain studies focus on performance degradation caused by sensor or scene variations, with limited attention to transferring LCLU models to cross-domain tasks with heterogeneous hierarchies (e.g., LCLU to crop classification). These limitations hinder the flexibility and generalization of LCLU models in practical applications. To address these challenges, we propose HieraRS, a novel hierarchical interpretation paradigm that enables multi-granularity predictions and supports the efficient transfer of LCLU models to cross-domain tasks with heterogeneous tree-structured hierarchies. We introduce the Bidirectional Hierarchical Consistency Constraint Mechanism (BHCCM), which can be seamlessly integrated into mainstream flat classification models to generate hierarchical predictions, while improving both semantic consistency and classification accuracy. Furthermore, we present TransLU, a dual-branch cross-domain transfer framework comprising two key components: Cross-Domain Knowledge Sharing (CDKS) and Cross-Domain Semantic Alignment (CDSA). TransLU supports dynamic category expansion and facilitates the effective adaptation of LCLU models to heterogeneous hierarchies. In addition, we construct MM-5B, a large-scale multi-modal hierarchical land use dataset featuring pixel-wise annotations. The code and MM-5B dataset will be released at: https://github.com/AI-Tianlong/HieraRS.",

Large models offer a solution via data generation. Nonetheless, real-world data are obviously more valuable comparing to artificially intelligence generated data, particularly in constructing image datasets. For this reason, we propose a novel method for auto-constructing datasets from real-world images by a multiagent collaborative system, named as DatasetAgent. By coordinating four different agents equipped with Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), as well as a tool package for image optimization, DatasetAgent is able to construct high-quality image datasets according to user-specified requirements. In particular, two types of experiments are conducted, including expanding existing datasets and creating new ones from scratch, on a variety of open-source datasets. In both cases, multiple image datasets constructed by DatasetAgent are used to train various vision models for image classification, object detection, and image segmentation.",

Several studies have shown that the performance of these 3D perception methods can be further enhanced by combining sequential BEV features obtained from multiple camera frames. However, even after compensating for the ego-motion of an autonomous agent, the performance gain from temporal aggregation is limited when combining a large number of image frames. This limitation arises due to dynamic changes in BEV features over time caused by object motion. In this paper, we introduce a novel temporal 3D perception method called OnlineBEV, which combines BEV features over time using a recurrent structure. This structure increases the effective number of combined features with minimal memory usage. However, it is critical to spatially align the features over time to maintain strong performance. OnlineBEV employs the Motion-guided BEV Fusion Network (MBFNet) to achieve temporal feature alignment. MBFNet extracts motion features from consecutive BEV frames and dynamically aligns historical BEV features with current ones using these motion features. To enforce temporal feature alignment explicitly, we use Temporal Consistency Learning Loss, which captures discrepancies between historical and target BEV features. Experiments conducted on the nuScenes benchmark demonstrate that OnlineBEV achieves significant performance gains over the current best method, SOLOFusion. OnlineBEV achieves 63.9% NDS on the nuScenes test set, recording state-of-the-art performance in the camera-only 3D object detection task.",

Little research, however, has investigated how generating analogies can support college students’ self-regulated learning (SRL) of biology. This study therefore evaluated a contextualized cognitive learning strategy intervention designed to teach students to generate analogies as a learning strategy to aid learning within a university biology course. Participants (n = 179) were taught how to generate analogies as a learning strategy to learn about plant and animal physiology. We hypothesized the quality of students’ generated analogies would increase over time, and their analogical reasoning, knowledge of cognition (KOC; a component of metacognitive awareness), and course performance would be higher after intervention, controlling for associated pre-intervention values. Regression analyses and repeated-measures analysis of variance indicated a positive relationship between generated-analogy quality and analogical reasoning, and increased analogy quality after intervention. No change in reported KOC was observed, and analogy quality did not predict course performance. Findings extend understanding of strategies that can support college students’ biology learning. Researchers and practitioners can leverage our approach to teaching analogies in their own research and classrooms to support students’ SRL, analogical reasoning, and learning.",

While ample research has highlighted the positive associations of expectancy beliefs and task values with academic achievement, research on students' perceived costs is in its infancy. We investigated the temporal interrelations among expectancies, task values and different types of perceived cost, the role of these constructs in biology achievement, and the role of perceived costs as a moderator in the relations of expectancy beliefs to biology achievement. A cross-lagged path analysis of semester-long data from 234 undergraduate biology students pointed to variable relations among expectancies, task values, perceived costs, and biology achievement. For example, while early expectancy beliefs related to later attainment and interest value, early task values and perceived costs did not relate to later expectancy beliefs. Furthermore, early attainment value related to later effort and opportunity cost. Expectancy beliefs and effort and opportunity cost in biology were associated with final biology grade. Finally, effort cost moderated the relations between expectancy beliefs and students' final grades. These findings provide evidence for the dynamic relations among perceived costs, task values, and expectancy beliefs over a semester and point to the interplay between expectancies and perceived costs in their relation to academic achievement in science.",

This is of concern because excessive anxiety can decrease student performance. Levels and sources of student anxiety in three introductory biology lecture classes were investigated via an online survey and student interviews. The survey (n = 327) data revealed that 16% of students had moderately high classroom anxiety, which differed among the three classes. All five active learning classroom practices that were investigated caused student anxiety, with students voluntarily answering a question or being called on to answer a question causing higher anxiety than working in groups, completing worksheets, or answering clicker questions. Interviews revealed that student anxiety seemed to align with communication apprehension, social anxiety, and test anxiety. Additionally, students with higher general anxiety were more likely to self-report lower course grade and the intention to leave the major. These data suggest that a subset of students in introductory biology experience anxiety in response to active learning, and its potential impacts should be investigated.",

          "input_text": "Ensemble of Weak Spectral Total Variation Learners: a PET-CT Case Study Solving computer vision problems through machine learning, one often encounters lack of sufficient training data. To mitigate this we propose the use of ensembles of weak learners based on spectral total-variation (STV) features (Gilboa 2014). The features are related to nonlinear eigenfunctions of the total-variation subgradient and can characterize well textures at various scales. It was shown (Burger et-al 2016) that, in the one-dimensional case, orthogonal features are generated, whereas in two-dimensions the features are empirically lowly correlated. Ensemble learning theory advocates the use of lowly correlated weak learners. We thus propose here to design ensembles using learners based on STV features. To show the effectiveness of this paradigm we examine a hard real-world medical imaging problem: the predictive value of computed tomography (CT) data for high uptake in positron emission tomography (PET) for patients suspected of skeletal metastases. The database consists of 457 scans with 1524 unique pairs of registered CT and PET slices. Our approach is compared to deep-learning methods and to Radiomics features, showing STV learners perform best (AUC=0.87), compared to neural nets (AUC=0.75) and Radiomics (AUC=0.79). We observe that fine STV scales in CT images are especially indicative for the presence of high uptake in PET.",

Hierarchical Multiple Regression and 5000 re-samples BC bootstrapping via the PROCESS macro were employed to test hypotheses and examine the relationship between student engagement and achievement. The study found that inquiry-based and computational thinking pedagogies improved achievement and retention, with ability, belief and intrinsic motivation as mediators. This study contributed to extant literature by integrating the mediators into computational thinking and inquiry-based learning, presenting a groundbreaking framework that enhances critical skills acquisition in Nigerian universities.

Sample & methods Undergraduate students (N = 152) learned from a video-recorded lecture, and then engaged in follow-up learning activities involving retrieval practice, restudy, elaboration, or a combination of retrieval practice with elaboration. We ensured that initial retrieval success was high and that all groups had the same expectations about the nature of content to be tested. We assessed both factual knowledge and comprehension, as well as the respective indicators of metacognitive-monitoring accuracy (metamemory, metacomprehension). We assessed self-efficacy and situational interest as motivational variables. Results In a one-week-delayed posttest, elaboration improved factual knowledge and comprehension. This pattern held whether learners just elaborated or additionally engaged in retrieval practice. Having students self-generate their own examples during retrieval practice improved comprehension, but merely letting students retrieve experimenter-provided examples did not.

          "input_text": "Disentangling Instance and Scene Contexts for 3D Semantic Scene Completion 3D Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) has gained increasing attention due to its pivotal role in 3D perception. Recent advancements have primarily focused on refining voxel-level features to construct 3D scenes. However, treating voxels as the basic interaction units inherently limits the utilization of class-level information, which is proven critical for enhancing the granularity of completion results. To address this, we propose \\textbf{D}isentangling Instance and Scene Contexts (DISC), a novel dual-stream paradigm that enhances learning for both instance and scene categories through separated optimization. Specifically, we replace voxel queries with discriminative class queries, which incorporate class-specific geometric and semantic priors. Additionally, we exploit the intrinsic properties of classes to design specialized decoding modules, facilitating targeted interactions and efficient class-level information flow. Experimental results demonstrate that DISC achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on both SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360 benchmarks, with mIoU scores of 17.35 and 20.55, respectively. Remarkably, DISC even outperforms multi-frame SOTA methods using only single-frame input and significantly improves instance category performance, surpassing both single-frame and multi-frame SOTA instance mIoU by 17.9\\% and 11.9\\%, respectively, on the SemanticKITTI hidden test.

Sample & methods Undergraduate students (N = 152) learned from a video-recorded lecture, and then engaged in follow-up learning activities involving retrieval practice, restudy, elaboration, or a combination of retrieval practice with elaboration. We ensured that initial retrieval success was high and that all groups had the same expectations about the nature of content to be tested. We assessed both factual knowledge and comprehension, as well as the respective indicators of metacognitive-monitoring accuracy (metamemory, metacomprehension). We assessed self-efficacy and situational interest as motivational variables. Results In a one-week-delayed posttest, elaboration improved factual knowledge and comprehension. This pattern held whether learners just elaborated or additionally engaged in retrieval practice. Having students self-generate their own examples during retrieval practice improved comprehension, but merely letting students retrieve experimenter-provided examples did not. Students' self-reported mental effort mediated the factual knowledge benefits of retrieval practice. The number of students’ self-generated elaborations mediated comprehension benefits. Students engaging in constructive retrieval while learning revealed the highest metacognitive-monitoring accuracy in factual knowledge and comprehension.

Therefore, effectively compressing SAMs has become an increasingly pressing practical need. In this study, we propose Birkhoff, a novel data-free compression algorithm for SAM and its variants. Unlike quantization, pruning, distillation, and other compression methods, Birkhoff embodies versatility across model types, agility in deployment, faithfulness to the original model, and compactness in model size. Specifically, Birkhoff introduces a novel compression algorithm: Hyper-Compression, whose core principle is to find a dense trajectory to turn a high-dimensional parameter vector into a low-dimensional scalar. Furthermore, Birkhoff designs a dedicated linear layer operator, HyperLinear, to fuse decompression and matrix multiplication to significantly accelerate inference of the compressed SAMs. Extensive experiments on 18 SAMs in the COCO, LVIS, and SA-1B datasets show that Birkhoff performs consistently and competitively in compression time, compression ratio, post-compression performance, and inference speed. For example, Birkhoff can achieve a compression ratio of 5.17x on SAM2-B, with less than 1% performance drop without using any fine-tuning data. Moreover, the compression is finished within 60 seconds for all models.",

A systematic review and meta-analyses The regulation of motivation is considered a key aspect of self-regulated learning (SRL) as it is presumed that maintaining an adequate level of motivation is essential for engagement, effort and persistence in academic tasks. In this review, we aimed to improve our understanding of motivational regulation strategies, their supposed antecedents and the educational implications. A search was conducted in Web of Science, Scopus, PsycInfo, and ERIC databases. Of 4027 records identified, 64 (75 studies) were deemed eligible after inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied and studies with low methodological quality were discarded. Data on 18 different motivational regulation strategies were available. Extrinsic/controlling types of strategies were reported to be used more frequently than intrinsic/autonomous strategies. Motivational regulation strategies were significantly associated with metamotivational beliefs, academic skills and adjustment. Available evidence supports assumptions of theoretical models on antecedents and academic implications of motivational self-regulation. Educational impact and implications statement The present study provides a compendium of the different motivational self-regulation strategies studied to date, describes the nature of these and unifies the different denominations used. The available evidence on the frequency of use of the different strategies that has been collected may be useful for educators, enabling them to anticipate and adapt to the status of the different motivational facets in students. Drawing on theoretical models of motivational self-regulation, the interconnections between the use of the strategies and their supposed antecedents and the expected educational implications were explored. This will provide researchers and educators with an interpretive framework to draw upon when adapting to interindividual diversity in strategy use and when assessing the compatibility between educational practices and the efficient use and training of motivational strategies.",

Sample & methods Undergraduate students (N = 152) learned from a video-recorded lecture, and then engaged in follow-up learning activities involving retrieval practice, restudy, elaboration, or a combination of retrieval practice with elaboration. We ensured that initial retrieval success was high and that all groups had the same expectations about the nature of content to be tested. We assessed both factual knowledge and comprehension, as well as the respective indicators of metacognitive-monitoring accuracy (metamemory, metacomprehension). We assessed self-efficacy and situational interest as motivational variables. Results In a one-week-delayed posttest, elaboration improved factual knowledge and comprehension. This pattern held whether learners just elaborated or additionally engaged in retrieval practice. Having students self-generate their own examples during retrieval practice improved comprehension, but merely letting students retrieve experimenter-provided examples did not. Students' self-reported mental effort mediated the factual knowledge benefits of retrieval practice. The number of students’ self-generated elaborations mediated comprehension benefits. Students engaging in constructive retrieval while learning revealed the highest metacognitive-monitoring accuracy in factual knowledge and comprehension. We found no differences between conditions regarding situational interest and self-efficacy. Motivation to reuse the respective learning strategies was higher in all conditions compared to restudy. Conclusion Constructive retrieval seems advantageous when considering its benefits on learning outcomes and metacognition. When working on retrieval tasks, students only profited from self-generated, but not from provided, examples with respect to comprehension.",

Large models offer a solution via data generation. Nonetheless, real-world data are obviously more valuable comparing to artificially intelligence generated data, particularly in constructing image datasets. For this reason, we propose a novel method for auto-constructing datasets from real-world images by a multiagent collaborative system, named as DatasetAgent. By coordinating four different agents equipped with Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), as well as a tool package for image optimization, DatasetAgent is able to construct high-quality image datasets according to user-specified requirements. In particular, two types of experiments are conducted, including expanding existing datasets and creating new ones from scratch, on a variety of open-source datasets. In both cases, multiple image datasets constructed by DatasetAgent are used to train various vision models for image classification, object detection, and image segmentation.",

          "input_text": "Hess-MC2: Sequential Monte Carlo Squared using Hessian Information and Second Order Proposals When performing Bayesian inference using Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods, two considerations arise: the accuracy of the posterior approximation and computational efficiency. To address computational demands, Sequential Monte Carlo Squared (SMC$^2$) is well-suited for high-performance computing (HPC) environments. The design of the proposal distribution within SMC$^2$ can improve accuracy and exploration of the posterior as poor proposals may lead to high variance in importance weights and particle degeneracy. The Metropolis-Adjusted Langevin Algorithm (MALA) uses gradient information so that particles preferentially explore regions of higher probability. In this paper, we extend this idea by incorporating second-order information, specifically the Hessian of the log-target. While second-order proposals have been explored previously in particle Markov Chain Monte Carlo (p-MCMC) methods, we are the first to introduce them within the SMC$^2$ framework. Second-order proposals not only use the gradient (first-order derivative), but also the curvature (second-order derivative) of the target distribution. Experimental results on synthetic models highlight the benefits of our approach in terms of step-size selection and posterior approximation accuracy when compared to other proposals.",

In 1966, Taylor constructed a free resolution for monomial ideals in polynomial rings, which Gemeda later showed admits a differential graded (DG) algebra structure. In 2002, Avramov proved that the Taylor resolution admits a DG algebra structure with divided powers. In 2007, Herzog introduced the generalized Taylor resolution, which is usually smaller than the original Taylor resolution. Recently, in 2023, VandeBogert showed that the generalized Taylor resolution also admits a DG algebra structure. In this paper, we extend Avramov's result by proving that the generalized Taylor resolution admits a DG algebra structure with divided powers. Along the way, we correct a sign error in VandeBogert's product formula. We provide applications concerning homotopy Lie algebras and resolutions of squarefree monomial ideals.",

Empirical Insights into Undergraduate Life Science Majors' Emotions about Mathematics Undergraduate life science majors are reputed to have negative emotions toward mathematics, yet little empirical evidence supports this. We sought to compare emotions of majors in the life sciences versus other natural sciences and math. We adapted the Attitudes toward the Subject of Chemistry Inventory to create an Attitudes toward the Subject of Mathematics Inventory (ASMI). We collected data from 359 science and math majors at two research universities and conducted a series of statistical tests that indicated that four AMSI items comprised a reasonable measure of students' emotional satisfaction with math. We then compared life science and non-life science majors and found that major had a small to moderate relationship with students' responses. Gender also had a small relationship with students' responses, while students' race, ethnicity, and year in school had no observable relationship. Using latent profile analysis, we identified three groups-students who were emotionally satisfied with math, emotionally dissatisfied with math, and neutral. These results and the emotional satisfaction with math scale should be useful for identifying differences in other undergraduate populations, determining the malleability of undergraduates' emotional satisfaction with math, and testing effects of interventions aimed at improving life science majors' attitudes toward math.",

Only parental education was directly related to achievement however gender and SES were indirectly linked to student grades through expectancy, STV, and the expectancy-STV interaction. Males, students with a higher level of parental education, and students from households with a higher number of possessions, all performed better in their examination due to higher expectations; higher STV amplified these relations. Gender and SES differences in achievement can be partly explained by psychological factors, namely students’ expectations of success and STV.",

Its ability to capture intrinsic similarities and differences among data samples has led to state-of-the-art results in computer vision tasks. These strengths make CL particularly well-suited for Earth System Observation (ESO), where diverse satellite modalities such as optical and SAR imagery offer naturally aligned views of the same geospatial regions. However, ESO presents unique challenges, including high inter-class similarity, scene clutter, and ambiguous boundaries, which complicate representation learning -- especially in low-label, multi-label settings. Existing CL frameworks often focus on intra-modality self-supervision or lack mechanisms for multi-label alignment and semantic precision across modalities. In this work, we introduce MoSAiC, a unified framework that jointly optimizes intra- and inter-modality contrastive learning with a multi-label supervised contrastive loss. Designed specifically for multi-modal satellite imagery, MoSAiC enables finer semantic disentanglement and more robust representation learning across spectrally similar and spatially complex classes. Experiments on two benchmark datasets, BigEarthNet V2.0 and Sent12MS, show that MoSAiC consistently outperforms both fully supervised and self-supervised baselines in terms of accuracy, cluster coherence, and generalization in low-label and high-class-overlap scenarios.",

The current study aimed to examine the temporal relations among expectancies, task values (intrinsic and utility value), and perceived costs (emotional and effort cost) in math to understand the underlying motivational processes for math-related career intention and achievement among middle school girls. To this end, we collected responses from 638 Korean middle school girls three separate times within a year. The autoregressive cross-lagged results revealed that there was no reciprocal relationship between expectancies and task values, but there appeared to be unidirectional positive prediction paths from utility value to self-efficacy. Regarding the costs, there were reciprocal relations between intrinsic value and emotional cost, which negatively affected each other. Consequently, utility value indirectly enhanced girls' math achievement by fostering self-efficacy, whereas emotional cost indirectly hindered their career intentions in math by dampening their intrinsic value. These findings suggest that it is important not only to increase task values, but also to manage costs to help adolescent girls adhere to their math-related career goals.",

CLiFT enables compute-efficient rendering by compressed tokens, while being capable of changing the number of tokens to represent a scene or render a novel view with one trained network. Concretely, given a set of images, multi-view encoder tokenizes the images with the camera poses. Latent-space K-means selects a reduced set of rays as cluster centroids using the tokens. The multi-view ``condenser'' compresses the information of all the tokens into the centroid tokens to construct CLiFTs. At test time, given a target view and a compute budget (i.e., the number of CLiFTs), the system collects the specified number of nearby tokens and synthesizes a novel view using a compute-adaptive renderer. Extensive experiments on RealEstate10K and DL3DV datasets quantitatively and qualitatively validate our approach, achieving significant data reduction with comparable rendering quality and the highest overall rendering score, while providing trade-offs of data size, rendering quality, and rendering speed.",

The focus of this study is the integration of CT into science teaching in the flipped classroom model. In this context, the effects of flipped computational science laboratory (Flipped-CSL) activities carried out with teacher candidates on CT skills, laboratory entrepreneurship, and attitude were investigated. An intertwined mixed research design, in which quantitative and qualitative data were evaluated together, was used in the study. Findings showed that flipped-CSL activities were effective for teacher candidates and improved their CT skills, laboratory entrepreneurship, and attitudes significantly and positively. The results of this study include the practical use of flipped-CSL activities when planning laboratory activities for school science subjects to improve CT skills. Implications for using of flipped-CSL activities in science education were discussed, and suggestions were made regarding the results.",

We examined whether two psychological variables, social anxiety (psychological distress relating to the fear of negative evaluation by others) and academic self-efficacy (confidence in one's ability to overcome academic challenges), interact with student perceptions of evidence-based instructional practices (EBIPs) and associate with their final grades in a STEM-related course. Human anatomy and physiology students in community college courses rated various EBIPs for their perceived educational value and their capacity to elicit anxiety (N = 227). In general, practices causing students the most anxiety (e.g., cold calling) were reported by students as having the least educational value. When controlling for students' self-reported grade point averages, socially anxious students rated several EBIPs as more anxiety inducing, whereas high-efficacy students reported less anxiety surrounding other EBIPs. Furthermore, mediation analysis revealed that individual differences in academic self-efficacy at the beginning of the term explained some of the negative association between students' social anxiety levels and final grades in the course. Our results, obtained in a community college context, support a growing body of evidence that social anxiety and academic self-efficacy are linked with how students perceive and perform in an active-learning environment.",

L-CLIPScore is calculated from a lightweight CLIP (L-CLIP), which is a dual-encoder architecture compressed and distilled from CLIP. To compress, we apply two powerful techniques which are weight multiplexing and matrix decomposition for reducing the parameters of encoders and word embedding matrix, respectively. To distill, we design a novel multi-modal Similarity Regulator (SR) loss to transfer more vision-language alignment knowledge. Specifically, SR loss amplifies the multi-modal embedding similarity if the given image-text pair is matched and diminishes the similarity if the pair is non-matched. By compressing and distilling by this novel SR loss, our L-CLIP achieves comparable multi-modal alignment ability to the original CLIP while it requires fewer computation resources and running time. We carry out exhaustive experiments to validate the efficiency and effectiveness of L-CLIPScore when using it as the judge to evaluate caption quality. We also discover that when using L-CLIPScore as the supervisor to train the captioning model, it should be mixed up by an n-gram-based metric and meanwhile analyze why using L-CLIPScore only will cause fail training.",

Curricular reform efforts in QR have been directed at disseminating course design and pedagogy but less work has been directed at understanding what faculty at large view as crucial for student success in their courses. We conducted semi-structured interviews of 15 faculty teaching in an introductory biology course sequence to determine (1) what participants viewed as QR competencies crucial for student success, and (2) their perceptions of student preparedness for QR in context. Participant responses fell into four categories (Quantitative Reasoning, Process of Science, Modeling, and Affective Factors) which largely align with competencies called for in recent publications. Additionally, participants noted that many students lacked these QR competencies upon matriculation. Characterization of QR skills crucial for success can help guide curricular reform not only in biology, but also in the context of other STEM disciplines.",

The focus of this study is the integration of CT into science teaching in the flipped classroom model. In this context, the effects of flipped computational science laboratory (Flipped-CSL) activities carried out with teacher candidates on CT skills, laboratory entrepreneurship, and attitude were investigated. An intertwined mixed research design, in which quantitative and qualitative data were evaluated together, was used in the study. Findings showed that flipped-CSL activities were effective for teacher candidates and improved their CT skills, laboratory entrepreneurship, and attitudes significantly and positively. The results of this study include the practical use of flipped-CSL activities when planning laboratory activities for school science subjects to improve CT skills. Implications for using of flipped-CSL activities in science education were discussed, and suggestions were made regarding the results.",

NeuralOS combines a recurrent neural network (RNN), which tracks computer state, with a diffusion-based neural renderer that generates screen images. The model is trained on a large-scale dataset of Ubuntu XFCE recordings, which include both randomly generated interactions and realistic interactions produced by AI agents. Experiments show that NeuralOS successfully renders realistic GUI sequences, accurately captures mouse interactions, and reliably predicts state transitions like application launches. Although modeling fine-grained keyboard interactions precisely remains challenging, NeuralOS offers a step toward creating fully adaptive, generative neural interfaces for future human-computer interaction systems.",

Several studies have shown that the performance of these 3D perception methods can be further enhanced by combining sequential BEV features obtained from multiple camera frames. However, even after compensating for the ego-motion of an autonomous agent, the performance gain from temporal aggregation is limited when combining a large number of image frames. This limitation arises due to dynamic changes in BEV features over time caused by object motion. In this paper, we introduce a novel temporal 3D perception method called OnlineBEV, which combines BEV features over time using a recurrent structure. This structure increases the effective number of combined features with minimal memory usage. However, it is critical to spatially align the features over time to maintain strong performance. OnlineBEV employs the Motion-guided BEV Fusion Network (MBFNet) to achieve temporal feature alignment. MBFNet extracts motion features from consecutive BEV frames and dynamically aligns historical BEV features with current ones using these motion features. To enforce temporal feature alignment explicitly, we use Temporal Consistency Learning Loss, which captures discrepancies between historical and target BEV features. Experiments conducted on the nuScenes benchmark demonstrate that OnlineBEV achieves significant performance gains over the current best method, SOLOFusion. OnlineBEV achieves 63.9% NDS on the nuScenes test set, recording state-of-the-art performance in the camera-only 3D object detection task.",

While hurricane preparedness and response strategies vastly rely on the accuracy and timeliness of the predicted households' evacuation decisions, current studies featuring psychological-driven linear models leave some significant limitations in practice. Hence, the present study proposes a new methodology for predicting households' evacuation decisions constructed by easily accessible demographic and resource-related predictors compared to current models with a high reliance on psychological factors. Meanwhile, an enhanced logistic regression (ELR) model that could automatically account for nonlinearities (i.e., univariate and bivariate threshold effects) by an interpretable machine learning approach is developed to secure the accuracy of the results. Specifically, low-depth decision trees are selected for nonlinearity detection to identify the critical thresholds, build a transparent model structure, and solidify the robustness. Then, an empirical dataset collected after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita is hired to examine the practicability of the new methodology. The results indicate that the enhanced logistic regression (ELR) model has the most convincing performance in explaining the variation of the households' evacuation decision in model fit and prediction capability compared to previous linear models. It suggests that the proposed methodology could provide a new tool and framework for the emergency management authorities to improve the estimation of evacuation traffic demands in a timely and accurate manner.",

Over-parameterized models such as deep neural networks have an interesting re-descending property in their risk characteristics. This is a recent phenomenon in machine learning and has been the subject of many studies. As the complexity of the model increases, there is a U-shaped region corresponding to the traditional bias-variance trade-off, but then as the number of parameters equals the number of observations and the model becomes one of interpolation, the risk can become infinite and then, in the over-parameterized region, it re-descends -- the double descent effect. We show that this has a natural Bayesian interpretation. Moreover, we show that it is not in conflict with the traditional Occam's razor that Bayesian models possess, in that they tend to prefer simpler models when possible. We illustrate the approach with an example of Bayesian model selection in neural networks. Finally, we conclude with directions for future research.",

Yet office hours, at times, remain an untapped source of academic support. The current study examined whether office hour attendance in combination with a learning reflection would help students learn material in an introductory statistics course. Psychology students were randomly assigned to meet in person with the course instructor and complete a learning reflection form prior to a test. Students who completed these tasks prior to the second test in the course outperformed other students. Office hour attendance combined with reflection may be a useful way to improve students’ understanding of statistics. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)",

Self-advocacy is defined as communicating individual wants, needs, and rights to determine and pursue required accommodations. While self-advocacy is linked to academic success, little is known about how students with disabilities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) practice self-advocacy. We previously developed a model of self-advocacy for STEM students with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and/or specific learning disabilities (SLD). Here, we use this model to examine what factors support or hinder self-advocacy in undergraduate STEM courses. We conducted semistructured interviews with 25 STEM majors with ADHD and/or SLD and used qualitative approaches to analyze our data. We found internal factors, or factors within a participant, and external factors, the situations and people, described by our participants, that influenced self-advocacy. These factors often interacted and functioned as a support or barrier, depending on the individuals and their unique experiences. We developed a model to understand how factors supported or hindered self-advocacy in STEM. Supporting factors contributed to a sense of comfort and security for our participants and informed their perceptions that accommodation use was accepted in a STEM course. We share implications for research and teaching based on our results.",

This is usually the case in digital pathology, which consists of gigapixel sized images. While deterministic attention-based MIL approaches achieve strong bag-level performance, they often overlook the uncertainty inherent in instance relevance. In this paper, we address the lack of uncertainty quantification in instance-level attention scores by introducing \\textbf{SGPMIL}, a new probabilistic attention-based MIL framework grounded in Sparse Gaussian Processes (SGP). By learning a posterior distribution over attention scores, SGPMIL enables principled uncertainty estimation, resulting in more reliable and calibrated instance relevance maps. Our approach not only preserves competitive bag-level performance but also significantly improves the quality and interpretability of instance-level predictions under uncertainty. SGPMIL extends prior work by introducing feature scaling in the SGP predictive mean function, leading to faster training, improved efficiency, and enhanced instance-level performance. Extensive experiments on multiple well-established digital pathology datasets highlight the effectiveness of our approach across both bag- and instance-level evaluations. Our code will be made publicly available.",

A systematic review and meta-analyses The regulation of motivation is considered a key aspect of self-regulated learning (SRL) as it is presumed that maintaining an adequate level of motivation is essential for engagement, effort and persistence in academic tasks. In this review, we aimed to improve our understanding of motivational regulation strategies, their supposed antecedents and the educational implications.

A systematic review and meta-analyses The regulation of motivation is considered a key aspect of self-regulated learning (SRL) as it is presumed that maintaining an adequate level of motivation is essential for engagement, effort and persistence in academic tasks. In this review, we aimed to improve our understanding of motivational regulation strategies, their supposed antecedents and the educational implications.

A search was conducted in Web of Science, Scopus, PsycInfo, and ERIC databases. Of 4027 records identified, 64 (75 studies) were deemed eligible after inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied and studies with low methodological quality were discarded. Data on 18 different motivational regulation strategies were available. Extrinsic/controlling types of strategies were reported to be used more frequently than intrinsic/autonomous strategies. Motivational regulation strategies were significantly associated with metamotivational beliefs, academic skills and adjustment. Available evidence supports assumptions of theoretical models on antecedents and academic implications of motivational self-regulation. Educational impact and implications statement The present study provides a compendium of the different motivational self-regulation strategies studied to date, describes the nature of these and unifies the different denominations used. The available evidence on the frequency of use of the different strategies that has been collected may be useful for educators, enabling them to anticipate and adapt to the status of the different motivational facets in students. Drawing on theoretical models of motivational self-regulation, the interconnections between the use of the strategies and their supposed antecedents and the expected educational implications were explored. This will provide researchers and educators with an interpretive framework to draw upon when adapting to interindividual diversity in strategy use and when assessing the compatibility between educational practices and the efficient use and training of motivational strategies.",

Of 4027 records identified, 64 (75 studies) were deemed eligible after inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied and studies with low methodological quality were discarded. Data on 18 different motivational regulation strategies were available. Extrinsic/controlling types of strategies were reported to be used more frequently than intrinsic/autonomous strategies. Motivational regulation strategies were significantly associated with metamotivational beliefs, academic skills and adjustment. Available evidence supports assumptions of theoretical models on antecedents and academic implications of motivational self-regulation. Educational impact and implications statement The present study provides a compendium of the different motivational self-regulation strategies studied to date, describes the nature of these and unifies the different denominations used. The available evidence on the frequency of use of the different strategies that has been collected may be useful for educators, enabling them to anticipate and adapt to the status of the different motivational facets in students. Drawing on theoretical models of motivational self-regulation, the interconnections between the use of the strategies and their supposed antecedents and the expected educational implications were explored. This will provide researchers and educators with an interpretive framework to draw upon when adapting to interindividual diversity in strategy use and when assessing the compatibility between educational practices and the efficient use and training of motivational strategies.",

A systematic review and meta-analyses The regulation of motivation is considered a key aspect of self-regulated learning (SRL) as it is presumed that maintaining an adequate level of motivation is essential for engagement, effort and persistence in academic tasks. In this review, we aimed to improve our understanding of motivational regulation strategies, their supposed antecedents and the educational implications. A search was conducted in Web of Science, Scopus, PsycInfo, and ERIC databases. Of 4027 records identified, 64 (75 studies) were deemed eligible after inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied and studies with low methodological quality were discarded. Data on 18 different motivational regulation strategies were available. Extrinsic/controlling types of strategies were reported to be used more frequently than intrinsic/autonomous strategies. Motivational regulation strategies were significantly associated with metamotivational beliefs, academic skills and adjustment. Available evidence supports assumptions of theoretical models on antecedents and academic implications of motivational self-regulation. Educational impact and implications statement The present study provides a compendium of the different motivational self-regulation strategies studied to date, describes the nature of these and unifies the different denominations used. The available evidence on the frequency of use of the different strategies that has been collected may be useful for educators, enabling them to anticipate and adapt to the status of the different motivational facets in students. Drawing on theoretical models of motivational self-regulation, the interconnections between the use of the strategies and their supposed antecedents and the expected educational implications were explored. This will provide researchers and educators with an interpretive framework to draw upon when adapting to interindividual diversity in strategy use and when assessing the compatibility between educational practices and the efficient use and training of motivational strategies.",
